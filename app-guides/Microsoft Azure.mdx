## Overview

ShiftControl supports both user sync and Single Sign-On (SSO) for Azure Entra ID. Once configured all users will need to sign in to Azure via JumpCloud.

Microsoft calls their Active Directory Microsoft Entra ID.

### Supported Licenses

Entra ID supports Single Sign-On (SSO) for all licenses and accounts!

### What you need to know

<Accordion title="Email addresses for users in Entra ID should match those in ShiftControl">
  Ideally, your email addresses in ShiftControl match those of Entra ID, this makes the configuration simpler.
  If you use a different domain in Entra ID, then you can add a specific domain to the directory configuration which will transform your email domain to the domain you have in Entra iD.

  For example, if your ShiftControl domain is example.com and your domain in EntraID is examplecloud.com, you can set examplecloud.com as the default domain in the Directory which will automatically convert any user using their first part of their email. That means user@example.com turns into user@examplecloud.com.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Schedule a maintenance window for this change">
  Azure/Entra ID is a sensitive app as it handles production workloads. You know your systems best, but people do forget things. There's a possibility that enabling SSO could force an account you are using to also require SSO. We've seen this happen for service accounts that are used for API access for example.

  We highly recommend scheduling this change during a maintenance window to avoid any impact to your operations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Once you turn on SSO, all users will be required to use it, unless configured otherwise">
  Enabling SSO enforces for all users in the federated domain.

  Make sure you have communicated to your users about the change and they are away of the new process for logging on.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Don't use the built-in default domain for federation">
  Federation of the built-in Microsoft domain (onmicrosoft.com) is not supported.
</Accordion>

## Configuration Options

You have two options for configuring the Azure integration.

1. [Complex] Fully integrate Azure AD with JumpCloud
    1. Users will be able to sign into Azure using their JumpCloud account directly
    2. Provides user provisioning and deprovisioning
2. [Simpler] Integrate SSO & Cloud Directory Sync for Azure (Entra ID)
    1. Provides user provisioning and deprovisioning
    2. Users will be able to sign into Azure using their JumpCloud account directly
    3. You will not be able to sign in to Azure without using JumpCloud

You can see more about the differences here: https://jumpcloud.com/support/Entra ID-directory-integration-and-saml-connector

This document focuses on option 2.

## Integrating SSO & Cloud Directory for Azure (Entra ID)

JumpCloud has a comprehensive (but slightly out of date) article here: https://jumpcloud.com/support/sso-with-Entra ID

### Prerequisites

There are some prerequisites that you’ll need to meet before you can complete this configuration.

1. You’ll need to enable Azure AD Cloud Directory Integration/Sync and ensure any user that you want to sign in via SSO to Azure is bound to that directory, if they aren’t, they won’t have a special immutable Microsoft ID.
2. PowerShell is required to modify Entra ID Federation configurations.
3. You must be using an account with the Global Admin role to complete this change.
    - Go to Entra ID > Users > select the user > Assigned Roles. Your account should have “Global administrator” listed
4. If MFA is enforced on end users in both environments, they will be prompted for MFA twice during the login process – once in JumpCloud and again in Entra ID
5. Confirm the following in Azure Active Directory > Custom Domain Names
    - The domain you would like to federate (e.g., YOUR_DOMAIN.com) is listed, verified, and not the Primary/(Default)
    - The onmicrosoft.com default domain or another domain you do not want to federate is the Primary/ (Default) domain. Set up a global admin account in your default domain (for example, admin@YOUR_DOMAIN.onmicrosoft.com) so that there is an admin account that can sign in outside of SSO as a failsafe

### Important Considerations
     
1. In Entra ID, MFA is automatically turned on when security defaults are enabled, regardless of your other MFA settings. If JumpCloud MFA is enabled while also having Entra ID MFA enabled, end users will encounter two separate MFA prompts during the same login
2. The default domain in Entra ID cannot be federated
3. When SSO is enabled, all users in the email domain you’re configuring SSO for are affected. After SSO is enabled, users aren’t able to log in to Azure using password authentication

### General Considerations

1. We do not support the GoDaddy implementation of Microsoft 365.

### Enable SSO in Azure

<Note>
This section requires Powershell. The instructions were written using Powershell on a Mac, but will work on a Windows computer.
</Note>

#### Install required modules
<Steps>
  <Step title="Install required modules">
    Install the following modules using the commands provided, and accept the install for each.
    ```powershell
    Install-Module PowershellGet
    Install-Module Microsoft.Graph
    Install-Module -Name JumpCloud.Office365.SSO
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install ExchangeOnline module [Optional]">
    If your Azure environment also has Exchange, then install the ExchangeOnline module as well.
    ```powershell
    Install-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the Execution policy">
    On a Windows computer, set the Execution policy. This is not required on a Mac.
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Connect to the Azure Tenant & Configure SSO

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to the Azure Entra ID tenant">
    Connect to the Azure Entra ID tenant using the Microsoft Graph module, so we can interact with the API.
    ```powershell
    Connect-MGGraph -Scopes "Domain.ReadWrite.All", "Directory.AccessAsUser.All", "Organization.ReadWrite.All", "Directory.ReadWrite.All"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Log in to Microsoft">
    You’ll receive a popup to log in to Microsoft. Make sure you log in with your Admin account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept the permission request">
    Accept the permission request.
    <img
      src="images/App-Guides/Azure/Azure - Accept Permission Request.png"
      alt="Accept the permission request"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authentication complete notice">
    You’ll receive a notice that authentication is complete. You can now close this window.
    <img
      src="images/App-Guides/Azure/Azure - Authentication Complete.png"
      alt="Authentication complete notice"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to Microsoft Exchange [Optional]">
    If you have a Microsoft Exchange instance in this Azure domain, you’ll need to connect to it as well.
    ```powershell
    Connect-ExchangeOnline
    ```
    <Note>
    Our testing environment does not have Exchange, so we don’t have the screenshots for this piece. We’ll work to add it!
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check SSO status">
    Check to make sure SSO isn’t already enabled on your domain. When prompted for a domain, enter the domain you’d like to integrate for SSO.
    ```powershell
    Get-MgDomain | Select Id, AuthenticationType
    ```
    You should see “Managed” for the domains, which means SSO is disabled. Here’s an example:
    ```powershell
    Get-MgDomain | Select Id, AuthenticationType

    Id                              AuthenticationType
    --                              ------------------
    danshiftcontrol.onmicrosoft.com Managed
    syssec.biz                      Managed
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Show SSO configuration">
    Run a command to show the SSO configuration.
    ```powershell
    Show-JumpCloud.Office365.SSO
    ```
    You’ll likely get another permission prompt. Accept it.
    <img
      src="images/App-Guides/Azure/Azure - Accept Permissions.png"
      alt="Show SSO configuration"
    />
    The return information includes the error message (404) if there’s no config found. That’s normal! Check for “Federation is not configured for domain: YOUR_DOMAIN” at the bottom. We expect it not to be configured. Here’s an example:
    ```powershell
    Show-JumpCloud.Office365.SSO

    cmdlet Show-JumpCloud.Office365.SSO at command pipeline position 1
    Supply values for the following parameters:
    Domain: syssec.biz

Congratulations, you are now configured for user synchronization and SSO for Azure!

## Assigning access for your users

You assign access to users just like you do for any other application. In ShiftControl, assign a group or individuals to the app and the app will be available for them in the console.

Your users will be able to login either from JumpCloud directly, or will be redirected to JumpCloud to complete their sign-in if they are coming from Microsoft.
<Note>
Each user that you assign in the application must also be assigned to the directory for synchronization. If this doesn’t happen, the process will be missing a key identifier to process the login! We are working on a feature to synchronize the application assignment and the Directory Sync assignment for Azure to make this easier. Right now, we suggest creating a group for Azure access and then assigning to the App and to the Cloud Directory, then any changes to the group remain in sync.
</Note>

When you add a user to the Cloud Directory they will receive an email that looks like this:
<img
  src="images/App-Guides/Azure/Azure - User Email.png"
  alt="User receives an email"
/>

When you add a user to the Azure application in JumpCloud, the next time they log in to JumpCloud they’ll receive this notice:
<img
  src="images/App-Guides/Azure/Azure - User Notice.png"
  alt="User receives a notice"
/>


Once they accept, they’ll be able to click on the Azure app, which redirects them to Microsoft and then logs them in once they choose their user. Here’s an example:
