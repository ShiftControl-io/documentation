## Overview

ShiftControl supports both user sync and Single Sign-On (SSO) for AWS. It also supports group sync, allowing you to control the membership and sync of groups in ShiftControl which can then be used in AWS to assign them to roles.

### Supported Licenses

Amazon Web Services supports Single Sign-On (SSO) for all licenses and accounts!

### What you need to know

<Accordion title="Email addresses for users in AWS must match those in ShiftControl">
  If you have existing users in AWS that you want to enforce SSO for, you'll need to make sure that the email addresses in AWS match those in ShiftControl.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Schedule a maintenance window for this change">
  AWS is a sensitive app as it handles production workloads. You know your systems best, but people do forget things. There's a possibility that enabling SSO could force an account you are using to also require SSO. We've seen this happen for service accounts that are used for API access for example.

  We highly recommend scheduling this change during a maintenance window to avoid any impact to your operations. While it is easy to turn off and on SSO in AWS, minimizing risk, all changes can be inherently risky, and we'd rather you use caution.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Once you turn on SSO, all users will be required to use it, unless configured otherwise">
  Enabling SSO enforces it across your accounts. You have configuration control in AWS to enforce in various ways, but the default configuration enables it for everything.

  Make sure you have communicated to your users about the change and they are away of the new process for logging on.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="AWS Identity Management works across all sub-accounts">
  You can use one central SSO configuration on your main account and tie it to all or some of your sub-accounts. We recommend using your main account in this way to avoid duplicative work and easy onboarding for new accounts.
</Accordion>

## Add a AWS Identity Center and Configure SSO

You've now configured SSO for AWS!

## Configure User Sync (Automatic Provisioning)

Automatic provisioning allows users to be provisioned and removed from AWS based on the group membership/app assignment in ShiftControl.

<Info>
üò† JumpCloud APIs do not yet allow us to fully configure user provisioning, you‚Äôll need to do this step in the JumpCloud platform. We‚Äôre actively working with JumpCloud to allow this kind of configuration via APIs.
</Info>

<Note>Configuring Automatic Provisioning is optional! It is, however, a powerful feature and we highly recommend enabling it!</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable automatic provisioning">
    In the settings for the identity provider in AWS click on the enable button in the Automatic provisioning callout box.
    <img
      src="images/App-Guides/AWS/AWS - Enable automatic provisioning.png"
      alt="Enable Automatic Provisioning"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="View your configuration items">
    You‚Äôll see two configuration items that you need for the JumpCloud side:
        1. SCIM Endpoint
        2. Access Token (Click on the Show Token Button)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Log in to JumpCloud's admin portal">
    Make sure you log in to the JumpCloud Admin portal with your admin account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access the AWS Application">
    Go to SSO Applications on the left hand side and then choose the AWS Identity Center app (Or AWS, depending on what you named it)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Identity Management">
    Click on the Identity Management tab and click on the Configure button next to Configuration Settings.
    <img
      src="images/App-Guides/AWS/AWS - JumpCloud Identity Management.png"
      alt="Enable Automatic Provisioning"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the SCIM Endpoint">
    Copy the SCIM Endpoint from AWS and paste it in the Base Url field in JumpCloud.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Access Token">
    Copy the Access Token from AWS and paste it into the Token Key in JumpCloud.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate identity management">
    Click Activate
    <img
      src="images/App-Guides/AWS/AWS - Activate Identity Management.png"
      alt="Activate identity management"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the changes">
    Click Save in the JumpCloud app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Close the pop-up on AWS">
    You can also close the pop-up on the AWS screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify User Sync is enabled">
    Refresh the Apps screen in ShiftControl, you‚Äôll now see User Sync enabled for the app.
    <img
      src="images/App-Guides/AWS/AWS - User Sync enabled.png"
      alt="Check User Sync"
    />
  </Step>
</Steps>

User Sync is now enabled for AWS!

## Pushing Groups and Users to AWS

Any group that is assigned to the app in ShiftControl will be pushed down to AWS where it can then be used to assign permissions & roles.

For example, let‚Äôs say you wanted to have a group called All Software Developers pushed to AWS.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a group">
    Create the group and modify the membership in ShiftControl.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign the group to the app">
    Go to the app and assign the group to the app and click Save.
    <img
      src="images/App-Guides/AWS/AWS - Assign the group.png"
      alt="Assign groups"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check that the group was synced in AWS">
    Now you‚Äôll see that group and anyone assigned to that group in AWS.
    <img
      src="images/App-Guides/AWS/AWS - Check group sync.png"
      alt="AWS Groups"
    />
    <img
      src="images/App-Guides/AWS/AWS - Check user sync.png"
      alt="AWS Users"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable automatic provisioning">
    Once you have created your permission sets, you can assign those to groups and accounts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

We leave the rest of the AWS configuration to the developers, as each organization is different!
