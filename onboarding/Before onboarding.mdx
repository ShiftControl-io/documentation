### JumpCloud Account Setup

You'll receive an email from Jumpcloud inviting you to create your user account. Please ensure you complete this step before the call.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Setup

As part of setting up your Jumpcloud account, you'll be prompted to enable MFA for security. Please have an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator or Authy) ready on your phone to complete the MFA setup during this process.

### Google Meet Access

During the onboarding call, we'll guide you through the process, so please be ready to share your screen. If this is your first time sharing your screen in Google Meet, you may need to adjust browser permissions and restart your browser.

### Google Workspace Admin Access

If you're integrating Google Workspace with ShiftControl, you'll need admin access to your Google Workspace account during the call.

We *may* need to troubleshoot potential authorization errors (e.g., Error 400) related to granting JumpCloud access to Google Workspace. We'll guide you through any adjustments necessary to unrestrict app access.

### Think About Your User Groups
Before the call, please think about at least one user group you'd like to set up during the session. This could be based on a team or department (e.g., 'Engineering'), a role (e.g., 'Founders'), or your entire core team. We'll help configure this group during the session.
