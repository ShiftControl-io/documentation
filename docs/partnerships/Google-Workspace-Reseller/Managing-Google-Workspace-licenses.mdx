## Overview

After transferring your Google Workspace billing to ShiftControl, you’ll now manage your Workspace licenses through our reseller channel.

This ensures smooth billing, consolidated support, and the ability for our team to assist you directly with provisioning and license adjustments.

## Adding or Removing Licenses

At this time, license changes need to be handled by the ShiftControl team.
