## Overview

You can easily transfer your existing Google Workspace billing account to ShiftControl.

This process allows us to help you manage licenses, billing, and support directly—without changing any of your existing user accounts or data.

## Requirements

Before you begin:

- You must be a **Google Workspace Super Admin**
- Your Google Workspace subscription must currently be billed directly by **Google**
- You’ll need to use the official Google Admin Console link below

## Steps to Transfer

<Steps>
    <Step title="Go to the Google Transfer Token Page">
    Visit [admin.google.com/TransferToken](http://admin.google.com/TransferToken)
    Make sure you’re signed in as a **Super Admin** for your Google Workspace domain.

</Step>

<Step title="Select Your Subscription">
    Under **Subscriptions from Google**, click **Transfer** next to your Google Workspace plan.

</Step>

</Steps>

## What Happens Next

Generating this transfer authorization gives **ShiftControl consent** to complete the billing transfer on your behalf.

Your Google Workspace subscription **has not yet been transferred** — our team will now process the transfer through Google’s reseller system.

Once the transfer is finalized:

- Your billing and license management will be handled through **ShiftControl** via our distributor **Ingram Micro ([cloudhk.im](http://cloudhk.im/))**
- You’ll continue using the same Google Workspace environment with **no disruption or data changes**
- We’ll notify you once the process is complete
