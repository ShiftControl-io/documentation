## What does ShiftControl Do?

Many smaller businesses don't have a dedicated IT person, so the task of managing IT is usually left to a founder, first engineer, or someone from Finance or HR! We've seen it all! We built ShiftControl to make it easy for anyone in the company to manage and control their IT environments with ease.

We believe that good identity management is the cornerstone of all strong and secure IT and business operations. Think about it, you use your identity for everything, from your email, to chat, talking to customers, and more. Why should you leave your identity management fragmented and insecure?

At the base of ShiftControl is a strong identity management platform called JumpCloud. JumpCloud provides you with a centralized identity, a directory for all your users, and strong multi-factor authentication that can be intrated with many services.

JumpCloud is very powerful, however, it required technical knowledge to operate. That's why ShiftControl, at it's core, is an administrative overlay on top of JumpCloud. We make it much easier to understand and manage your identity, and then we add a bunch of additional features on top of that to make it easier and more automatic to do things like onboard/offboard users, identity and control your SaaS costs, and so much more.
