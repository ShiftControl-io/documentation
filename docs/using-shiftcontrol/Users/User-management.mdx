## Overview

**User Management** provides a centralized view of all users within the ShiftControl platform. From here, you can view user details and take actions either individually or in bulk.

## View and Discover Users

- **User List**: A table displaying all users within the organization, including their names and email addresses.
- **Search**: Use the search bar to search across various parameters, such as name, email, and other attributes to quickly find specific users.

## Adding a User

Click the [Add User](/using-shiftcontrol/Users/Adding-a-user) button located at the top of the screen to invite new users. This opens a form where you can input the new user's details, including their name, email, and role assignments.

## Editing Users

Clicking the [Edit](/using-shiftcontrol/Users/Editing-a-user) button next to any user in the list will take you to the user details page, where you can modify their information. We will cover the specific details in a separate section.

## User Actions

You can take the following actions on individual users by using the dropdown menu next to each user:

    width={250}
/>

- **Cancel Scheduled Activation**: Cancel any scheduled activation for the user.
- **Schedule Deactivation**: Set a date for deactivating the user.
- **Resend Activation**: Resend the activation email to the user.
- **Disable User**: Disable the user account immediately.
- **Force Password Reset**: Force the user to reset their password upon the next login.
- **Set Password**: Manually set a password for the user.

## Bulk Actions

Bulk actions allow you to perform actions on multiple users at once. Select the users you wish to manage, and then choose from the following actions:

/>
- **Activate/Deactivate**: Activate or deactivate multiple users in one step.
- **Resend Activation**: Resend the activation email to all selected users.
- **Cancel Scheduled Activation**: Cancel activations that are scheduled for multiple users.
- **Password Management**: Perform bulk password management actions such as resetting passwords or forcing password resets.
- **Disable**: Disable multiple users at once.

The system will always indicate which actions are available based on the status of the selected users.
