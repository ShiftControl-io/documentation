<p style={{fontSize: "large"}}>How to manage and track tasks that require attention for you and your organization.</p>

## Overview

ShiftControl monitors your environment continuously -- discovering new apps and flagging items that need human decisions. When something requires your attention, it surfaces as a **task**. Task Management is your single queue for these actionable items, so nothing falls through the cracks.

## How It Works

Tasks are generated automatically by ShiftControl when events occur that need an admin's review. Currently, the primary source of tasks is **App Discovery** -- when ShiftControl detects a new application being used in your environment, it creates an "App discovery available" task so you can decide whether to manage it, ignore it, or investigate further.

Each task includes a title, details about what triggered it, the relevant app or assignment, and the date it was created. Tasks remain in the queue until you act on them.

## Common Scenarios

| Scenario | What to do |
|---|---|
| **New app detected** | An "App discovery available" task appears. Review the app, then decide to add it to your managed apps or dismiss the task. |
| **Bulk cleanup** | Multiple discovery tasks have accumulated. Select them all and use bulk actions to dismiss the ones you do not need. |
| **Triage during onboarding** | Filter to Pending tasks to see what needs attention first. Work through items one at a time. |

## Accessing Task Management

Click the **bell icon** in the top-left corner of the ShiftControl interface. A blue dot on the bell indicates unread tasks.

You can also reach Task Management from anywhere using the Command Bar: press **Cmd + K**, then **Cmd + T**.

## Viewing Tasks

The task list displays all items requiring your attention. The table includes:

- **Title** -- A short description of the task (for example, "App discovery available").
- **Details** -- Additional context about what triggered the task.
- **Assignment** -- The user, app, or group related to the task.
- **Created** -- The date the task was generated.

Use the **search bar** to find specific tasks by keyword. Use the **filter** dropdown to narrow the list by status, such as Pending.

The list paginates automatically. Navigation controls at the bottom show your position (for example, "1 to 10 of 70, Page 1 of 7").

## Task Actions

Each task supports the following actions:

- **Dismiss** -- Remove the task from your queue. Use this when the task is resolved or no longer relevant.
- **Mark as Unread** -- Flag the task for later review. It stays in the queue but resets to an unread state so you do not forget it.

## Bulk Actions

When tasks accumulate, process them in batches:

1. Select multiple tasks using the checkboxes.
2. Click the **Bulk Actions** button.
3. Choose an action (Dismiss or Mark as Unread) to apply to all selected tasks at once.

This is especially useful for clearing out a backlog of discovery notifications.

## Things to Know

- Tasks are generated automatically. You do not create them manually.
- Dismissing a task removes it from the queue permanently. If a similar event occurs again, a new task will be created.
- The bell icon's blue dot clears once all tasks have been read.
- Tasks do not expire on their own. They remain in the Pending state until you take action.
- The most common task type is "App discovery available," which appears when ShiftControl detects an application your organization is using but has not yet added to management.
