## Overview

The **Group Management** page allows administrators to manage user groups efficiently. You can see a list of all available groups along with descriptions, the last update date, and several actions for managing those groups.

## View and Discover Groups

- **Group List**: A table displaying all groups within the organization, including their names, descriptions, and last update dates.
- **Search**: Use the search bar to search for specific groups by name or description.

## Adding a Group

Clicking the [Add Group](/using-shiftcontrol/Groups/Adding-a-group) button located at the top of the screen to create a new group. This opens a form where you can input the group's name, description, and other settings.

## Editing a Group

Clicking the [Edit](/using-shiftcontrol/Groups/Editing-a-group) button next to any group in the list will take you to the group details page, where you can modify its information. We will cover the specific details in a separate section.

## Group Actions

You can take the following actions on individual groups by using the dropdown menu next to each group:

- **Delete**: Permanently delete the group.

## Quick View Capability

The **Quick View** feature provides an immediate snapshot of the users in a group without navigating away from the main page. With this tool, you can quickly check:
- Which users are assigned to the group.
- How the users were added (via individual assignment, dynamic assignment, or nested group assignment).

This makes it easier to assess group composition and user access at a glance.
