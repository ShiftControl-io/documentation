<p style={{fontSize: "large"}}>How to add a new group and configure assignments.</p>

## Overview

Adding a group allows you to create a new group and assign users to it in different ways. You can assign users to a group using dynamic assignments, nested assignments, or individual assignments.

## What Groups Are Used For

Groups are essential for managing users and automating access control. You can use groups for the following purposes:

1. **Sync Groups with Other Apps**

Groups and their membership can be synced with apps like Google Workspace, ensuring that user access remains consistent across platforms.

2. **Assign Applications to Users**

Groups can be used to assign specific applications to users, making it easy to manage app permissions for multiple users at once.

3. **Use Groups as Nested Groups**

Groups can be used as **nested groups**, meaning one group can be part of another. This allows for flexible user management by automatically inheriting permissions and memberships from other groups.
