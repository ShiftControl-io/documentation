<p style={{fontSize: "large"}}>How to edit a group and understanding the different ways to assign users.</p>

## Overview
When editing a group, you can configure all three tabsâ€”dynamic assignments, nested assignments, and individual assignments. You can choose to assign users using one or any combination of these methods.

## Editing a group

### Group Details

<Steps>

    <Step title="Navigate to the Group Management Pane">
        From the dashboard, navigate to the **Group Management** pane where all groups are listed.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Select the Group to Edit">
        Find the group you wish to edit and click the **Edit** button in the same row as the group name.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Edit Group Details">
        In the edit view, you can modify fields like the group name, description, and other settings.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure Dynamic Assignments">
        Dynamic assignments allow you to automatically populate a group's membership based on user profile attributes.

        - You can create rules based on user profile attributes such as **Cost Center**, **Department**, or other
        fields.
        - For example, you can assign all users in the **Operations** or **Human Resources** departments to a group.
        - You can combine multiple rules, such as adding an **AND** condition that specifies both the department and the
        company.

        Attributes available for dynamic assignment include:
        1. **Cost Center**
        2. **Department**
        3. **Description**
        4. **Primary Email**
        5. **Employee Type**
        6. **Job Title**
        7. **Location**
        8. **Manager**
        9. **User State**

    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure Nested Assignments">
        With nested assignments, you can include one group as part of another.

        - Click on the **Nested** tab when editing the group.
        - Select other groups you'd like to include as part of the current group.

        **Only one level of nesting is supported!** If this group is already used as a nested group in another group,
        you'll see the warning shown below.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure Individual Assignments">
        Individual assignments allow you to manually add specific users to the group.

        - Click on the **Individual Assignments** tab.
        - Search for a user by name and add them to the group.

        This gives you flexibility to assign specific users manually if needed.

        <img src="/img/ShiftControl/Groups/Group-individual-assignments.png" alt="Group individual assignments"/>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Save Changes">
        Once you've configured the group assignments, click **Save All** to apply the changes. The group will now
        reflect the updated membership based on the assignments you've made.
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Grioup Info Sidebar

In the **Edit Group** section, there is also a collapsible sidebar that provides additional information about the group. The sidebar includes information about the group rules, users assigned to the group, and apps that use the group for assignments.

<Admonition type="info">
    You can hover over the icons in the sidebar to see more information about how users are assigned to the group.
