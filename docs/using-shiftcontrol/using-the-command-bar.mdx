## How to Use the Command Bar

1. **Accessing the Command Bar:**

The command bar can be accessed from any page within the ShiftControl Dashboard by using the shortcut `âŒ˜ + K` (for macOS) or `Windows + K` (for Windows) to open it. You can also click the command bar at the top of the page.

2. **Searching:**

Simply start typing in the command bar to search across **users**, **groups**, and **apps**. The search functionality will display matching results in real-time, allowing you to navigate to the specific item with ease.

3. **Executing Shortcuts:**

In addition to search, the command bar supports predefined key sequences for fast navigation. For example, you can type the following key sequences:
- Typing the letter `A` followed by `U` (`A`, `U`) will navigate to the **Add User** section.
- Similarly, typing `A` followed by `G` (`A`, `G`) will navigate to the **Add Group** section.
- These sequences allow you to perform actions quickly without searching through menus.

## Search Functionality

The command bar is capable of searching across multiple entities, including:

- **Users**: Search for specific users by name or email and navigate directly to their profile or management screen.
- **Groups**: Easily search for user groups by name and view their details.
- **Apps**: Search for apps within the platform and access their management or configuration pages.

By leveraging the search functionality, you can quickly locate and manage resources without navigating through multiple menus.
