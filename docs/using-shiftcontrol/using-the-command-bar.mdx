## Overview

Clicking through menus is slow. The **Command Bar** gives you keyboard-driven access to everything in ShiftControl -- search for users, jump to a page, or start a workflow -- all without lifting your hands from the keyboard. If you have used Spotlight on macOS or the command palette in VS Code, the concept is the same.

## How It Works

The Command Bar is a search-and-action overlay available on every page in ShiftControl. It works in two modes:

1. **Search mode** -- Open the Command Bar and start typing to search across users, groups, and apps. Results appear in real time and you can select one to navigate directly to it.
2. **Shortcut mode** -- Press a key sequence (like `A` then `U`) from anywhere in ShiftControl to jump straight to an action such as adding a user. You do not need to open the Command Bar first -- shortcuts work directly from any page.

## Common Scenarios

| Scenario | What to do |
|---|---|
| **Find a user quickly** | Open the Command Bar, type part of their name or email, select from results. |
| **Add a new user** | Press `A` then `U` from any page. You are taken directly to the Add User form. |
| **Jump to the dashboard** | Press `Cmd` then `D` from anywhere. |
| **Check your tasks** | Press `Cmd` then `T` to go straight to the task list. |
| **Navigate to a specific app** | Open the Command Bar, type the app name, select it from the results. |

## Opening the Command Bar

Use any of these methods:

- Press **Cmd + K** on macOS (or **Ctrl + K** on Windows).
- Click the **Quick Search** bar at the top of any page.

The Command Bar opens as an overlay. Press **Esc** or click outside to close it.

## Searching

With the Command Bar open, start typing. ShiftControl searches across:

- **Users** -- by name or email.
- **Groups** -- by group name.
- **Apps** -- by app name.

Results update as you type. Select a result to navigate directly to that item's detail page.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

ShiftControl supports key sequences for common actions. These shortcuts work from any page -- you do not need to open the Command Bar first.

### Quick Access

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Cmd` then `D` | Go to Dashboard |
| `Cmd` then `T` | Go to Tasks |

### Add Something

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `A` then `U` | Add User |
| `A` then `G` | Add Group |
| `A` then `A` | Add App |

### Go to a Section

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `G` then `U` | Go to Users |
| `G` then `G` | Go to Groups |
| `G` then `A` | Go to Apps |
| `G` then `D` | Go to App Discovery |
| `G` then `I` | Go to Integrations |

The pattern is consistent: `A` means "add," `G` means "go to," and the second key identifies the target.

## Things to Know

- The Command Bar is available on every page. You do not need to navigate to a specific section first.
- Keyboard shortcuts are key sequences, not simultaneous key presses. Press the first key, release it, then press the second.
- Search is not case-sensitive. Partial matches work.
- The Command Bar closes automatically after you select a result or execute a shortcut.
