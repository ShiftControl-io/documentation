<p style={{fontSize: "large"}}>Create a dedicated JumpCloud service admin, generate an API key, and find your Organization ID to complete the ShiftControl integration.</p>

## Overview

During onboarding we'll provide you with a unique link to connect ShiftControl to your JumpCloud instance. This link takes you to a secure form where you'll enter the API key and Organization ID you create in the steps below.

The JumpCloud guide walks you through creating a dedicated service admin, generating an API key, and locating your Organization ID. Using a service account improves security, reduces operational risk, and makes it clear which actions are automated by ShiftControl in JumpCloud Directory Insights.

## Why Use a Service Account

- Separation of duties and clearer audit trail (actions show the service account as the actor in Directory Insights)
- Avoids outages when a personal admin leaves and their account is disabled or deleted
- No additional JumpCloud license cost for creating an admin account
- Simplifies security controls and credential rotation

Recommended pattern:
- Create a Google Group named "ShiftControl Service" with an address like `shiftcontrol-service@yourdomain.com`
- Add yourself (and relevant admins) to the group
- Use that group email to create the JumpCloud service admin and receive password notifications

## 1) Create a JumpCloud Service Admin

Note: Only Admins with the "Administrator with Billing" role can create new admin accounts.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open JumpCloud Administrators">
        Log in to the JumpCloud Admin Portal. In the top-right corner, click your initials, then click <b>Administrators</b> to open Settings â†’ Administrators.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add a New Admin">
        Click <b>+ Admin</b> and select <b>As New</b>.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Enter Account Details">
        - First Name:  <code>ShiftControl</code>
        - Last Name:  <code>Service</code>
        - Administrator Email Address: (use your service address, e.g., <code>shiftcontrol-service@yourdomain.com</code>)
    </Step>

    <Step title="Assign Role and API Access">
        - Under Permissions, choose an <code>Administrator with Billing</code> as the role.
        - Select the checkbox <b>Enable API access</b>, enabling it.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create and Activate">
        Click <b>Create</b>. JumpCloud sends an email to the specified address with a link for setting the initial password. Use that link to set the password and activate the account, then you can sign into the Admin Portal with the new service admin.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## 2) Generate an API Key

To generate an API key in JumpCloud as an administrator:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Sign in as the Service Admin">
        Log in to the JumpCloud Admin Portal using the new service admin account.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Open My API Key">
        Click your initials/profile icon in the top-right corner and select <b>My API Key</b>.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Generate New Key">
        In the "My API Key" pop-up, click <b>Generate New API Key</b>. Set the key to never expire.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Use It Immediately">
        Copy the key and paste it directly into the ShiftControl onboarding form. Do not store it elsewhere; you can always revoke and generate a new one later if needed.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## 3) Find Your Organization ID

You will also need your JumpCloud Organization ID for the onboarding form.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open Settings">
        Log into the JumpCloud Admin Portal, find <b>Settings</b> in the left side menu toward the bottom and click it.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Organization Profile">
        In Settings, you'll be in the <b>Organization Profile</b> (or Account Overview) page by default.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Copy the Organization ID">
        Locate the Organization ID. Click the eye icon to reveal it and the double-page icon to copy it to your clipboard. Paste it into the ShiftControl onboarding form.
    </Step>
</Steps>
