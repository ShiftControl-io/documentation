<p style={{fontSize: "large"}}>Connect Omni HR to ShiftControl and make HR data your single source of truth for user management.</p>

## Overview

The Omni HR integration allows you to connect your Omni HR system to ShiftControl, enabling HR data to become the single source of truth for user management across your organization. This integration is particularly valuable for our Asia-based customers, as Omni HR ships no native IdP connectors.

## Why It Matters

- **Single Source of Truth**: Turn Omni HR into a single source of truth for identities—no more manual spreadsheet uploads
- **First Seamless Path**: ShiftControl delivers the first seamless path from HR to downstream apps for Omni HR users
- **Automated Lifecycle Management**: Automatically handle user provisioning, updates, and deprovisioning
- **Streamlined Operations**: Eliminate manual data entry and reduce human error

## Key Features

- **Full-Field Synchronization**: Manager, department, start date, and every other key attribute flow straight into ShiftControl
- **On-Demand Sync**: Don't want to wait for the hourly update? Simply go to the actions menu for the integration and click "Refresh data" to start a new sync
- **Pre-Start Provisioning**: Five days before a new hire's start date, we silently enable the account so Gmail, Calendar, and Docs are ready without sending the welcome email
- **Automatic Status Management**: Automatic disable/re-enable keeps your roster accurate and compliant

## How It Works

ShiftControl polls Omni HR hourly to spot new hires, role changes, and departures. The integration automatically detects and processes changes, ensuring your user data is always up-to-date across all connected systems.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create an Omni HR Report

Before setting up the integration in ShiftControl, you need to create a report in Omni HR that exposes the employee fields required for the integration:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Prepare a user account for API access">
        - You'll need a user account to access the Omni HR API
        - The integration leverages Omni HR's access control system to retrieve data
    </Step>

    <Step title="Navigate to Reports in Omni HR">
        Access the Reports section in your Omni HR dashboard
        
        <img
            src="/img/ShiftControl/Integrations/OmniHR/OmniHR-reports-nav.png"
            alt="Navigate to Reports"
            height="500"
        />
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create a custom report">
        Click on the option to create a new report
        
        <img
            src="/img/ShiftControl/Integrations/OmniHR/OmniHR-reports-create.png"
            alt="Create custom report"
        />
    </Step>

    <Step title="Set up the report">
        - Click on `Add Report`
        - Click on `master report`
        - Use the interface to select the fields you need for the report
        
        <img
            src="/img/ShiftControl/Integrations/OmniHR/OmniHR-reports-fields.png"
            alt="Select report fields"
        />
        <Admonition type="important">
            Do not choose custom fields as they are not supported at the moment.
        </Admonition>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Include required fields">
        Make sure to include the following required fields in your report:

        | HRIS Field | ShiftControl Field |
        |------------|-------------------|
        | Basic->Preferred name | N/A |
        | Basic->Employee ID | N/A |
        | Contacts - email->Email (Work) | email |
        | Employment->Start date | N/A |
        | Employment->Last day of work | N/A |
        | Employment->Status | N/A |
        | Job->Company | company |
        | Job->Department | department |
        | Job->Position | jobTitle |
        | Job->Location | location |
        | Job->Employment type | N/A |
        | Team->Manager | manager |

    </Step>

    <Step title="Create the report">
        After selecting all required fields, create and save the report
    </Step>

    <Step title="Get the report ID">
        Contact the support team to obtain the unique ID for your report
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Add Authorization in ShiftControl

Once you have created the report in Omni HR and have obtained the report ID, you can set up the integration in ShiftControl:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Add the Omni HR App">
        Navigate to Integrations → Omni HR and select "Add Authorization"
    </Step>

    <Step title="Provide Credentials">
        Enter the following lightweight credentials:
        - Username & Password – an Omni HR account with read access
        - Omni HR Domain – e.g., acme.omnihr.co
        - Custom Report ID – the ID of the report you created in the previous step
    </Step>

    <Step title="Authorize the Integration">
        Click "Authorize" to complete the setup
    </Step>

    <Step title="Monitor Synchronization">
        ShiftControl will begin synchronizing with Omni HR automatically
    </Step>
</Steps>
