<p style={{fontSize: "large"}}>Connect Dream Team to ShiftControl and make HR data your single source of truth for user management.</p>

## Overview

The Dream Team connector allows you to connect your Dream Team system to ShiftControl, enabling HR data to become the single source of truth for user management across your organization. This connector streamlines user provisioning, updates, and lifecycle management based on your HR records.

## Why It Matters

- **HR-Driven Identity**: Your HR data becomes the single source of truth for identity management
- **Clean User Records**: Maintains accurate user information during organizational changes
- **License Optimization**: Saves on JumpCloud licenses by creating users only when needed
- **Automated Lifecycle Management**: Automatically handles user provisioning, updates, and deprovisioning

## Advantages Over JumpCloud's Built-in Connector

Our Dream Team connector offers several improvements over JumpCloud's native connector:

- **Full Field Synchronization**: Manager and other key attributes now flow through completely
- **Scoped Credentials**: Supply ShiftControl with a limited Dream Team token (no need to share JumpCloud super-admin credentials with Dream Team)
- **Cost Savings**: Unlike JumpCloud's native integration that may create staged users before their start date (costing you license fees), ShiftControl creates users only when actually needed

## How It Works

1. **Regular Synchronization**: ShiftControl polls Dream Team regularly and compares records
2. **Comprehensive Change Detection**: Automatically detects adds, updates, disables, and re-enables
3. **Smart Pre-start Provisioning**: 5 days before a new hire's start date, we enable the account in silent mode so Gmail, Calendar, and Docs are ready without emailing the user

## Retrieving Dream Team Tokens

ShiftControl uses your Dream Team API tokens to read employee data. To retrieve them, sign in to your Dream Team account and go to: https://app.dreamteam.io/my-settings

<Steps>
    <Step title="Sign in to Dream Team">
        Sign in to your Dream Team instance with administrator permissions.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Open Your Settings">
        Navigate to https://app.dreamteam.io/my-settings in your browser (or go to My Settings from the UI).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Copy Access and Refresh Tokens">
        On the settings page, locate the API section and copy both the <strong>Access token</strong> and the <strong>Refresh token</strong>. You'll temporary store them on in a text file or secure location. You will provide them to ShiftControl during setup.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
    <Step title="Add the Dream Team App">
        Navigate to Integrations → Dream Team and select "Add Authorization" in ShiftControl.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Provide Tokens">
        - Enter the Access token
        - Enter the Refresh token
    </Step>

    <Step title="Authorize the Connector">
        Click "Authorize" to complete the setup. ShiftControl will validate the tokens and begin initial synchronization.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Monitor Synchronization">
        ShiftControl will begin synchronizing with Dream Team automatically — check the connector status page for progress and any errors.
    </Step>
</Steps>
