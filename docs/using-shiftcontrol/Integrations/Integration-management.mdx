<p style={{fontSize: "large"}}>How to manage and monitor the health of your integrations.</p>

## Overview
**Integration Management** allows you to configure and monitor the health of your app integrations. You can view the status of your integrations, update or delete authorizations, and disable or enable integrations.

We're constantly working on new integrations! If you don't see an integration you need, please let us know. We'll do our best to add it to our roadmap.

## View and Discover Integrations

- **Integration List**: The integration list displays all your available integrations, showing their current health status, service health, and any actions that need to be taken. You can quickly see whether an integration requires your attention, like re-authenticating or updating credentials.
- **Search**: Use the search bar to search for specific integrations by name or description. This is useful if you manage a large number of integrations and need to locate a particular one quickly.

### Integration Health

**Integration Health** reflects whether ShiftControl can successfully connect to the service using your provided credentials. This status indicates whether the app can interact with the integration based on the authentication you've set up.

### Service Health

**Service Health** shows the overall status of the service itself, meaning whether ShiftControl can reach the service, regardless of your specific credentials. Even if your integration is set up correctly, this status helps you determine whether there are service outages or issues from the provider side.

## Integration Actions

In the **Actions Menu**, you can:
- **Add an Authorization**: Add new credentials to connect to the integration.
- **Update an Authorization**: Update the credentials to restore or modify the connection.
- **Delete an Authorization**: Remove the credentials used for the integration.
- **Disable an Integration**: Temporarily disable the integration, preventing ShiftControl from querying it until re-enabled.
