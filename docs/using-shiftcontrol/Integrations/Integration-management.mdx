## Overview
**Integration Management** allows you to configure and monitor the health of your app integrations. You can view the status of your integrations, update or delete authorizations, and disable or enable integrations.

## What are ShiftControl Integrations?

ShiftControl integrations are designed to bridge the gap between what your license tier in most apps provides and what we can achieve with their native APIs. Our integrations expand the capabilities of both ShiftControl and your SaaS applications by enabling deeper communication between systems to extract information that SaaS providers typically restrict to expensive enterprise tiers.

In simpler terms, we help you get more value from your existing software investments without upgrading to costly enterprise plans.

## Types of Integrations

### HRIS Integrations (HR-driven Identity)

Our HRIS integrations allow ShiftControl to pull in employee profile information and manage the employee lifecycle directly from your HR system. This approach, known as HR-driven identity, ensures that your HR data becomes the single source of truth for user management across all your systems.

Benefits include:
- Automated user provisioning based on HR data
- Streamlined employee onboarding and offboarding
- Reduced manual data entry and human error
- Cost savings on license fees

### User Management and Information Gathering

These integrations enable ShiftControl to verify user information across your applications. For example, our Slack integration can verify the number of users in your Slack workspace, identify which users exist, and determine who has admin privileges.

This verification helps ensure that what you have in ShiftControl accurately reflects reality across your organization.

Some of these integrations allow:
- **Full user management**: Creating, updating, and disabling user accounts
- **Read-only access**: Viewing user data without modification capabilities

- **Integration List**: The integration list displays all your available integrations, showing their current health status, service health, and any actions that need to be taken. You can quickly see whether an integration requires your attention, like re-authenticating or updating credentials.
- **Search**: Use the search bar to search for specific integrations by name or description. This is useful if you manage a large number of integrations and need to locate a particular one quickly.

### Integration Health

**Integration Health** reflects whether ShiftControl can successfully connect to the service using your provided credentials. This status indicates whether the app can interact with the integration based on the authentication you've set up.

### Service Health

**Service Health** shows the overall status of the service itself, meaning whether ShiftControl can reach the service, regardless of your specific credentials. Even if your integration is set up correctly, this status helps you determine whether there are service outages or issues from the provider side.

## Integration Actions

In the **Actions Menu**, you can:
- **Add an Authorization**: Add new credentials to connect to the integration.
- **Update an Authorization**: Update the credentials to restore or modify the connection.
- **Delete an Authorization**: Remove the credentials used for the integration.
- **Disable an Integration**: Temporarily disable the integration, preventing ShiftControl from querying it until re-enabled.
