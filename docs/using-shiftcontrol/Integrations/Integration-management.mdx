## Overview

**Integration Management** provides an overview of how ShiftControl connects to external systems and manages communication between your apps, identity providers, and HR systems.

Integrations are now organized into two areas:
- **[Directories](/using-shiftcontrol/Settings/Directories)** — for HRIS and identity provider connections
- **[App Connectors](/using-shiftcontrol/Settings/App-Connectors)** — for third-party SaaS applications

From these sections, you can view integration health, reauthenticate connections, and enable or disable integrations.

<Admonition type="tip">
    If you previously managed integrations in the **Integration Management** screen, you’ll now find them under **Connectors** in the Settings menu.

## What are ShiftControl Integrations?

ShiftControl integrations bridge the gap between what standard SaaS license tiers allow and what’s possible through direct API access.
They enhance visibility, automation, and control across your environment — without requiring enterprise-tier subscriptions.

In short, integrations help you get more value from your existing tools.

### Examples of what integrations can do:
- Sync employee data from HRIS tools like **BambooHR** or **HiBob**
- Manage user accounts via identity providers like **JumpCloud** or **Google Workspace**
- Pull user lists and license information from SaaS apps like **Slack** or **HubSpot**

## Types of Integrations

### HRIS and Identity Integrations (Directories)

**Directories** manage integrations with HR systems and identity providers that serve as your organization’s source of truth.
They handle core data like users, departments, and locations — and power HR-driven identity workflows.

Common benefits include:
- Automated user provisioning and deprovisioning
- Streamlined onboarding and offboarding
- Fewer manual data entry errors
- Consistent, centralized user data across platforms

### SaaS App Integrations (App Connectors)

**App Connectors** allow ShiftControl to communicate with SaaS tools directly — often to pull user data, verify license usage, or check app configurations.
These connectors ensure that what you see in ShiftControl matches what’s happening in each system.

Examples:
- **Slack** – Check workspace users, admins, and account status
- **HubSpot** – Sync user access and license details
- **Box** – View shared user activity and access lists

## Monitoring Integration Health

**Integration Health** indicates whether ShiftControl can successfully connect using your current credentials.
If the health status shows a warning, it may mean the authorization token expired or the service requires reauthentication.

**Service Health** shows whether ShiftControl can reach the external service itself — independent of your credentials — to help diagnose provider outages or network issues.

<Admonition type="note">
    For both directories and app connectors, ShiftControl automatically checks integration and service health during each sync cycle.
