<p style={{fontSize: "large"}}>How to manage and monitor the health of your connectors.</p>

## Overview

**Connector Management** provides an overview of how ShiftControl connects to external systems and manages communication between your apps, identity providers, and HR systems.

Connectors are now organized into two areas:
- **[Directories](/using-shiftcontrol/Settings/directories)** — for HRIS and identity provider connections
- **[App Connectors](/using-shiftcontrol/Settings/app-connectors)** — for third-party SaaS applications

From these sections, you can view connector health, reauthenticate connections, and enable or disable connectors.

<Admonition type="tip">
    If you previously managed connectors in the **Connector Management** screen, you'll now find them under **Connectors** in the Settings menu.

## What are ShiftControl Connectors?

ShiftControl connectors bridge the gap between what standard SaaS license tiers allow and what's possible through direct API access.
They enhance visibility, automation, and control across your environment — without requiring enterprise-tier subscriptions.

In short, connectors help you get more value from your existing tools.

### Examples of what connectors can do:
- Sync employee data from HRIS tools like **BambooHR** or **HiBob**
- Manage user accounts via identity providers like **JumpCloud** or **Google Workspace**
- Pull user lists and license information from SaaS apps like **Slack** or **HubSpot**

## Types of Connectors

### HRIS and Identity Connectors (Directories)

**Directories** manage connectors with HR systems and identity providers that serve as your organization's source of truth.
They handle core data like users, departments, and locations — and power HR-driven identity workflows.

Common benefits include:
- Automated user provisioning and deprovisioning
- Streamlined onboarding and offboarding
- Fewer manual data entry errors
- Consistent, centralized user data across platforms

### SaaS App Connectors (App Connectors)

**App Connectors** allow ShiftControl to communicate with SaaS tools directly — often to pull user data, verify license usage, or check app configurations.
These connectors ensure that what you see in ShiftControl matches what's happening in each system.

Examples:
- **Slack** – Check workspace users, admins, and account status
- **HubSpot** – Sync user access and license details
- **Box** – View shared user activity and access lists

## Monitoring Connector Health

**Connector Health** indicates whether ShiftControl can successfully connect using your current credentials.
If the health status shows a warning, it may mean the authorization token expired or the service requires reauthentication.

**Service Health** shows whether ShiftControl can reach the external service itself — independent of your credentials — to help diagnose provider outages or network issues.

<Admonition type="note">
    For both directories and app connectors, ShiftControl automatically checks connector and service health during each sync cycle.
