<p style={{fontSize: "large"}}>A quick guide on adding and managing apps.</p>

## Overview

Adding an app to ShiftControl makes it available for assignment to users and groups. Once added, the app appears in the App Management dashboard and can be shown in the employee portal. You can add apps from a catalog of 983+ pre-configured applications, or create custom apps for tools not in the catalog.

## How It Works

ShiftControl provides two ways to add apps:

1. **From the App Catalog** -- browse or search pre-configured apps. Each catalog entry shows which functionality it supports (Bookmark, SSO, JIT provisioning, User sync). You choose whether to add it as an SSO app or a Bookmark.
2. **Custom apps** -- for apps not in the catalog. You can create a Custom SSO Integration (SAML/OIDC) or a Custom Bookmark with your own name, icon, and URL.

    alt="App catalog"
/>

The catalog shows supported functionality badges for each app so you can see at a glance whether SSO, JIT provisioning, or user sync are available. Each app row has action buttons -- "Add bookmark" and/or "Add SSO app" -- depending on what that app supports.

## Types of Apps

### SSO Apps (SAML and OIDC)

SSO apps provide true single sign-on. Users authenticate through ShiftControl and are logged in to the app automatically -- no separate password required. This is the most secure option because you control the authentication flow, can enforce MFA, and can revoke access instantly.

Use SSO when: your app supports SAML or OIDC and your license tier includes SSO.

### Bookmarks

Bookmarks are portal links. The app appears in the employee App Dashboard and users can click to open it, but they log in to the app separately. No authentication flows through ShiftControl.

Use Bookmarks when:
- The app doesn't support SSO.
- Your license tier doesn't include SSO yet.
- You want the app in the portal for discoverability while you plan the SSO rollout.

Bookmarks can be upgraded to SSO apps at any time without losing assignments.

## Common Scenarios

### Your app is in the catalog and supports SSO

Search the catalog, click "Add SSO app," configure the connection, assign groups, and save. Follow the app-specific SSO guide for detailed settings.

### Your app is in the catalog but you're not ready for SSO

Search the catalog, click "Add bookmark." The app appears in the portal immediately. You can configure SSO later by editing the app.

### Your app is not in the catalog

Click "+ Add Custom" and choose either "Custom SSO Integration" or "Custom Bookmark." You'll provide the app name, description, URL, and (for SSO) the SAML/OIDC configuration.

## Adding an SSO App from the Catalog

## Things to Know

- The App Catalog contains 983+ pre-configured apps. If your app isn't listed, use the Custom option.
- Functionality badges in the catalog (Bookmark, SSO, JIT provisioning, User sync) tell you what the app supports before you add it. Not all features may be available on every license tier.
- A Bookmark can be upgraded to SSO later without recreating the app or losing group assignments.
- Group assignments are the recommended way to manage app access. Individual assignments work but don't scale well.
- SSO configuration details vary by app. Check the app-specific SSO guide for the correct settings.
