## Overview

Editing an app allows you to modify the appâ€™s settings, such as the name, description, and user assignments. The process differs slightly between **Bookmarks** and **SSO/SAML apps**.

You can refer to the [Adding an App](/using-shiftcontrol/Apps/Adding-an-app) guide for more detailed instructions for each of the steps below.

## Editing an App

To edit an app, follow these steps:

<Steps>

    <Step title="Navigate to the App Management Pane">
        From the dashboard, navigate to the **App Management** pane where all apps are listed.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Select the App to Edit">
        Find the app you wish to edit and click the **Edit** button next to its name.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Edit General Information">
        In the **General** tab, modify the app name and description.
        - If you are editing a **Bookmark**, update the **Bookmark URL** field.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure SSO Settings (for SSO/SAML Apps)">
        If you are editing an SSO/SAML app, go to the **SSO** tab to configure the Single Sign-On settings.
        - You can download the **IDP public certificate** or the **SSO config metadata** for downstream applications.
