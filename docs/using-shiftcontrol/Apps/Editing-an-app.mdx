<p style={{fontSize: "large"}}>How to edit bookmarks and SSO apps, and configure groups and users.</p>

## Overview

After adding an app, you manage everything about it from the app detail page. This includes basic information, subscription and cost tracking, SSO configuration, and user assignments. The detail page is organized into tabs so you can work on one area at a time without losing changes.

## How It Works

Click any app in the App Management table to open its detail page. The page has three main tabs:

- **General** -- app identity, ownership, and basic settings.
- **Subscription** -- plan details, billing, and cost tracking.
- **Assignments** -- groups and individual users assigned to the app.

A sidebar on the right shows a summary of the app's assigned users and groups for quick reference.

## The General Tab

The General tab controls how the app appears and who is responsible for it.

| Field | What It Controls |
|-------|-----------------|
| **App name** | The display name shown in the dashboard and employee portal. |
| **Primary admin** | The person responsible for managing this app day-to-day. |
| **Budget owner** | The person responsible for the app's costs and renewals. |
| **Owning department** | The department that owns this app (e.g., Engineering, Marketing). |
| **Description** | A description visible to employees in their App Dashboard. |
| **Bookmark URL** | (Bookmarks only) The URL users are sent to when they click the app. |

## The Subscription Tab

The Subscription tab lets you track plan details and costs for the app. ShiftControl uses this information to calculate the estimated total cost shown in the App Management table.

| Field | What It Controls |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Plan duration** | How long the current plan lasts (e.g., 12 months). |
| **Duration type** | Whether the duration is in months or years. |
| **Billing cycle** | How often you're billed (monthly, annually, etc.). |
| **Renewal grace period** | How many days after expiration you have before the plan lapses. |
| **Plan end / renewal date** | When the plan ends or auto-renews. |
| **Cost structure** | How costs are calculated (e.g., per user, flat rate). |
| **Currency** | The currency for all cost fields (e.g., USD). |
| **Cost** | The per-unit or flat cost (e.g., $84.00 per user). |
| **Platform fee** | Toggle for whether there's an additional platform fee. |
| **Notes** | Free-text notes about the subscription (e.g., contract terms, discount details). |

## The Assignments Tab

The Assignments tab controls who has access to the app. There are two sub-tabs:

- **Groups** -- assign groups to the app. All members of the group automatically receive access. This is the recommended approach.
- **Individual** -- assign specific users directly, outside of any group.

Click **Add group** to assign a new group. To assign individual users, switch to the Individual sub-tab.

## SSO Configuration (SSO Apps Only)

For SSO SAML and SSO OIDC apps, the SSO settings are available during editing. From here you can:

- View and download the **IDP public certificate**.
- Download the **SSO config metadata** to provide to the app vendor.
- Configure SAML assertion settings, attribute mappings, and other protocol-specific fields.

## The App Info Sidebar

The right sidebar shows a quick summary of the app's assignments without leaving the current tab.

### Groups View
Shows which groups are assigned to this app.

/>

### Users View
Shows the individual users who have access (both through groups and direct assignment).

    width={"400"}
/>

## Common Scenarios

### Upgrading a Bookmark to SSO

Open the Bookmark app, configure the SSO settings with the SAML or OIDC details from the app vendor, change the type, and save. All existing group and user assignments are preserved.

### Tracking renewal dates and costs

Open the app's Subscription tab and fill in the plan duration, renewal date, and per-user cost. When you return to App Management, the estimated total cost column reflects your entries.

### Changing who has access

Open the Assignments tab and add or remove groups. Group changes take effect immediately -- all members of an added group gain access, and members of a removed group lose access (unless they also have an individual assignment).

    <Step title="Edit Assignments">
        Switch to the **Assignments** tab to add or remove groups and individual users.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure SSO (if applicable)">
        For SSO apps, configure the SAML or OIDC settings. Download the IDP certificate or metadata as needed.

## Things to Know

- Changes to group assignments take effect immediately after saving. Users in a removed group lose access unless they also have a direct individual assignment.
- The Subscription tab is for your tracking purposes. ShiftControl does not connect to vendors to pull billing data automatically.
- You can navigate between tabs without losing unsaved work. Just click Save when you're done.
- The sidebar updates in real time as you add or remove groups and users.
- Bookmark apps do not have SSO configuration options. To add SSO, you need to change the app type.
