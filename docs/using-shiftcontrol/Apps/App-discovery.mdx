<p style={{fontSize: "large"}}>How to use the App Discovery to discover applications in your organization.</p>

## Overview

**App Discovery** helps you identify and manage all the applications your organization is using, making it easier to track what apps are in use, who is using them, and how they are being utilized. App discovery provides an automatic discovery process, pulling information from integrated platforms to give you a comprehensive view of your app ecosystem.

## Automatic Discovery of Apps

Once you connect integrations like Google Workspace, ShiftControl will periodically scan for new apps, pull various info/metrics from the apps, and display them in **App Discovery**. We currently support Google Workspace as a discovery integration, with more integrations coming soon.

App Discovery helps you understand what apps are being used in your organization, who is using them, and how they are being accessed. This information is crucial for managing app access, ensuring security, and optimizing app usage across your organization. Additionally, you can use App Discovery to add new apps to ShiftControl so you can manage access and make it available on the employee portal.

## View Discovered Apps

- **Discovered App List**: The list of apps we've discovered, including their source, current state, and activity information.
- **Search**: Use the search bar to find specific apps.
- **Filters**: Filter the list based on the state.

### App Discovery Details

You can expand each discovered app to see more details for the activity we collected for the app, including who took which actions and when.

## Adding a Discovered App

Clicking the [Add to apps](/using-shiftcontrol/Apps/Adding-an-app) button next to any discovered app will take you to the app catalog, where you can add the app to your organization. You can configure the app settings, assign groups, and make it available to users in the employee portal.

## Discovered App Actions

You can take the following actions on discovered apps:
- **Snooze**: Temporarily hide the app from the list. It'll show up again if we see new events for the app.
- **Dismiss**: Permanently remove the app from the list.
- **Reset**: Reset the state back to pending. This is useful if you want to re-review the app.

You can always view snoozed, dismissed, or added apps using the state filter.

## Bulk Actions

You can also take bulk actions on multiple apps at once. Select the apps you want to manage, then click the **Bulk Actions** button to take the same actions as are available in individual app actions.
