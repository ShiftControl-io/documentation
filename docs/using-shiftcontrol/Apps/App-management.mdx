## Overview

The **App Management** dashboard allows you see an overview of all your applications, including which apps are shown to your users in their employee portal. You can add, edit, and delete apps, making it easier to manage user access and track app usage across your organization.

We recommend adding every SaaS app in your organization to ShiftControl, even if you aren't ready to integrate Single Sign-on authentication. That's because apps can be either SSO Apps or Bookmarks, allowing you full control and flexibility.

### Benefits of adding all your apps

	1.	**Unified Access:** When you add all apps and assign users in ShiftControl, your users will see all their assigned apps in their App Dashboard. This centralizes access and makes it easier for new users to discover and access their apps without needing to remember each app’s website.
	2.	**Streamlined Provisioning:** Setting up all apps early facilitates the enablement of automatic provisioning and deprovisioning via user sync. User sync is often a premium feature on many SaaS services. We’re working to integrate user sync into lower license tiers for many services. By setting up your apps, groups, and assignments in advance, turning on user sync will be seamless and effortless.
	3.	**Improved Security:** Adding all apps allows for better visibility and management of app usage within your organization. This enhances security by ensuring that access to each app is controlled and monitored, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
	4.	**Enhanced Productivity:** With all apps centralized in ShiftControl, employees spend less time searching for the right tools and more time being productive. The App Dashboard becomes a single point of entry for all work-related applications.
	5.	**Simplified Onboarding:** New hires can be onboarded more quickly as they will have immediate access to all necessary apps from day one. This reduces the time and effort required for IT to manually set up each user.
	6.	**Centralized Management**: ShiftControl provides a single platform to manage all your SaaS applications, making it easier to track app usage, manage licenses, and monitor user access. This centralized management simplifies IT operations and reduces administrative overhead.
	7.	**Scalability:** As your organization grows, having all apps already set up in ShiftControl allows you to scale seamlessly. Adding new users, groups, and apps becomes a straightforward process, supporting your organization’s expansion.
	8.	**Compliance and Reporting:** With all apps managed in one place, it’s easier to ensure compliance with organizational policies and regulatory requirements. ShiftControl can provide detailed reports on app usage and access, aiding in audits and compliance checks.

Integrating all your SaaS applications into ShiftControl not only enhances operational efficiency but also strengthens security and simplifies user management. Take advantage of ShiftControl’s capabilities to optimize your app management strategy.

We make discovering apps easier through App Discovery, which helps you find and add new apps to your organization. This feature is especially useful for discovering new apps that can enhance your team's productivity and collaboration.

## View and Discover Apps

The App Management dashboard provides you with a comprehensive view of all the apps in your organization, including the following details:
- **App Type**: Whether the app is a **Bookmark** or an **SSO/SAML** application.
- **Portal Visibility**: Whether the app is shown in the user portal.
- **User Sync**: Whether user sync is configured for the app.
- **Groups Assigned**: How many groups are assigned to the app.

You can also use the search bar to find specific apps by name or description.

## Adding an App

## Editing an App

Clicking the [Edit](/using-shiftcontrol/Apps/Editing-an-app) button next to any app in the list will take you to the app details page, where you can modify its information. We will cover the specific details in a separate section.
