## Overview

The **App Spend Dashboard** helps you track software costs, identify high-cost apps and users, and uncover opportunities to optimize your SaaS budget.
It aggregates subscription data across your connected apps to provide a clear view of where your organization’s software spend is going.

Key metrics include:
- **Total Apps** – The total number of apps with active subscriptions.
- **Active Users** – The number of users currently assigned to paid apps.
- **Total Cost for All Apps** – Combined annual and monthly costs for all subscriptions.
- **Average Cost per Active User** – Average software cost per employee based on active usage.

## App Spend by Department Usage

The **App Spend by** visualization shows how your SaaS budget is distributed across departments such as Sales, Marketing, Engineering, and Support.
You can toggle between different grouping modes like *department usage* or *app category* to analyze spend patterns.

This breakdown helps you:
- Identify which teams drive the most SaaS spend
- Detect underutilized licenses in smaller departments
- Plan reallocation of budgets for upcoming renewals



## Subscription Renewals

The **Subscription Renewals** panel lists upcoming renewals within a selected timeframe.
Use the filters to sort:
- **Per app** – View renewals by individual applications
- **Per department** – Track renewals by organizational unit
- **Next 12 months / 6 months / 30 days** – Adjust the lookahead window

Each renewal entry displays:
- App name and icon
- Cost and billing frequency
- Renewal date

## Top-Spend Apps

The **Top-Spend Apps** section lists applications with the highest total cost.
These are typically your largest SaaS investments and prime candidates for optimization or negotiation.

Each app card displays:
- Monthly and annual cost
- Ranking based on total yearly spend

Example:
1. Salesforce — $1,208/month ($14,500/year)
2. HubSpot — $842/month ($10,100/year)
3. Google Workspace — $330/month ($3,960/year)



## Top-Spend Monthly Apps

This section compares **Monthly Plans** vs **Annual Plans** and suggests cost-saving opportunities by switching to annual billing cycles.

You’ll see:
- A spend distribution bar between monthly and annual subscriptions
- A per-app savings estimate (e.g., “Save $463 by switching Zoom to annual billing”)

<Admonition type="note">
    Annual plans typically come with 10–20% discounts and simplify budgeting for finance teams.

## Complete Subscription Info

If any subscription lacks cost or renewal data, you’ll see a **Complete subscription info** prompt.
Adding this data enables more accurate reporting and helps the dashboard calculate renewal forecasts and per-user cost metrics.

Examples of missing subscriptions:
- Apple Business Manager
- AWS
- Canva

## High-Cost Users

The **High-Cost Users** panel highlights users with above-average SaaS costs based on their assigned apps.
Each user’s spend is compared to the organization’s mean SaaS cost per user.


This insight helps you:
- Identify over-licensed or duplicate tool usage
- Detect users with overlapping app access
- Reassign or consolidate licenses during renewal planning



## Using the Dashboard for Spend Optimization

Use the App Spend Dashboard to:
- Track and forecast renewal costs across all apps
- Identify high-cost subscriptions for renegotiation
- Reduce spend by shifting from monthly to annual plans
- Detect underutilized apps and reallocate licenses
