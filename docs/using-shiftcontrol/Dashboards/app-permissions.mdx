<p style={{fontSize: "large"}}>Monitor third-party app permissions across your organization and identify potential access risks before they become security incidents.</p>

## Overview

Every time an employee clicks "Sign in with Google" or authorizes a third-party app, they are granting that app access to your organization's data. Most of these authorizations are harmless -- a project management tool reading a user's profile, for example. But some grant access to email, shared drives, or directory data, and those permissions persist until someone explicitly revokes them.

The **App Permissions Dashboard** exists to make this invisible web of access visible. It shows you every third-party app that users have authorized, what level of access each app has, and which users are responsible. Instead of discovering risky integrations during a security incident, you can proactively monitor and manage them.

## How It Works

ShiftControl pulls OAuth authorization logs from Google Workspace and aggregates them into a unified view. Every time a user in your organization grants or revokes access to a third-party app through their Google account, that event is captured and reflected in this dashboard.

The dashboard classifies each app's permissions into risk tiers based on the scope of data access requested. An app that only reads a user's basic profile is treated differently from one that can read email or modify shared drive files. This classification powers the header metrics and the risk-based filtering throughout the dashboard.

Header metrics give you the big picture at a glance:

- **Total Apps** -- The number of distinct third-party apps that have been authorized across your organization (e.g., 812 apps).
- **Total Authorizations** -- The total number of active authorization grants (e.g., 121 authorizations), since a single app can be authorized by multiple users.
- **Unique Users** -- How many individual users have authorized at least one third-party app (e.g., 64 users).
- **At Risk Users** -- Users who have authorized apps with sensitive or restricted permissions (e.g., 13 users), flagged for priority review.

<Admonition type="tip">
    Use the date filter at the top-right of the dashboard to switch between views such as <strong>Year to date</strong>, <strong>Last 90 days</strong>, or <strong>All time</strong> to focus your review on the most relevant timeframe.

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Quarterly security audit

Your security team runs a quarterly review of third-party access. Open the App Permissions Dashboard, filter to the last 90 days, and review the "Apps with Higher Risk Permissions" section. You find that a marketing tool was recently authorized with email read access by three users. You verify whether the tool is approved, and if not, coordinate revocation through your identity provider.

### Scenario: Employee offboarding

When an employee leaves, you need to ensure their third-party authorizations are revoked. Use the "Users Who Granted Permissions" section to search for the departing user and see every app they authorized. Cross-reference this with your offboarding checklist to confirm all access has been removed.

### Scenario: Investigating a suspicious authorization spike

The Authorizations and Revocations chart shows an unusual spike in new authorizations last Tuesday. You drill into the Third-Party Apps list filtered to that date range and discover that a team rolled out a new integration without going through IT approval. You can assess the permissions it requested and decide whether to allow or revoke it organization-wide.

## Authorizations and Revocations Over Time

The line chart on the left side of the dashboard tracks **Authorizations** and **Revocations** over time. This trend view is valuable because single-day snapshots miss the patterns that matter:

- **Steady growth in authorizations** suggests users are continuously adding new tools, which may indicate shadow IT growth.
- **Spikes in authorizations** often correspond to tool rollouts, team onboarding, or integration deployments.
- **Spikes in revocations** typically indicate security reviews, offboarding events, or policy enforcement actions.

Tracking both lines together gives you a sense of whether your organization's third-party access surface is expanding or being actively managed.

## Third-Party Apps and Services

The apps list shows every third-party service that users have connected through their Google accounts. Each entry displays the app name, its icon for quick identification, and a summary of the permissions it was granted.

You can filter this list by:

- **Permission level** -- View all permissions, or narrow to only sensitive or restricted grants
- **Permission type** -- Filter by specific permission types to focus your review

This is your master inventory of third-party integrations. When someone asks "what apps have access to our data?" this list is the answer.

## Apps with Higher Risk Permissions

This section filters specifically to apps that have been granted **sensitive** or **restricted** permissions. These are the apps that can read email, access shared drives, sync contacts, or perform other high-impact operations on behalf of your users.

The section shows the number of permission types in play (e.g., 240 permission types across your sensitive and restricted apps), giving you a sense of the breadth of access that has been granted.

For each flagged app, you should consider:

- **Is this app approved for business use?** If not, it should be revoked.
- **Who granted access?** A single user authorizing a niche tool is different from half your organization using it.
- **Are the permissions proportional?** An app that needs calendar access but also requests email read permissions deserves scrutiny.

<Admonition type="warning">
    Pay close attention to apps with permissions involving email, file access, or directory data. These represent the highest data exposure risk and should be reviewed during every security audit.
</Admonition>

## Users Who Granted Permissions

The final panel shifts the view from apps to people. It shows which users have authorized external apps, displayed with user avatars for quick identification, along with the specific services they connected.

This user-centric view helps you:

- **Identify power authorizers** -- Users who have granted access to an unusually high number of apps
- **Support offboarding** -- Quickly see all third-party access tied to a specific user
- **Enforce policy** -- Spot users who may have authorized apps that violate your organization's security policies

You can filter by app to see all users who authorized a specific service, or by user to see every app a particular person has connected.

<Admonition type="tip">
    Combine this view with your identity provider logs to cross-reference OAuth connections with employee access policies. This is especially useful during compliance reviews.

## Things to Know

- **Data comes from Google Workspace OAuth logs.** This dashboard only shows authorizations made through Google accounts. Apps authorized through other identity providers are not reflected here.
- **"At Risk Users" is based on permission classification.** A user is flagged as at risk if they have authorized any app with sensitive or restricted permissions, regardless of whether that app is approved by IT.
- **Revocation happens in your identity provider.** The dashboard surfaces the data, but revoking an app's access is done through Google Workspace admin controls, not directly in ShiftControl.
- **Authorization counts include historical grants.** If a user authorized an app six months ago and never revoked it, that authorization still appears in the totals.
- **New apps may take time to classify.** Freshly authorized apps appear immediately, but their risk classification may update as ShiftControl processes the permission scopes.
