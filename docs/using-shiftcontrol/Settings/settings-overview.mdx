## Overview

The **Settings** area is where users and administrators manage both individual and organization-wide preferences.
It’s divided into two main sections: **Personal Settings** and **Org Settings**.
This layout helps distinguish between user-specific configurations (like profile or appearance) and organization-level management (like group tags or user roles).
