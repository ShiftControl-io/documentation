## Overview

The **Account Settings** page displays your personal profile information and security methods.
This area provides a quick view of your identity within ShiftControl — including your name, email, title, and department — as well as access to your authentication and security settings.

## Profile Information

The **Profile** tab includes your basic user details:
- **First name** and **Last name**
- **Primary email**
- **Title**
- **Department**

This information is sourced from your directory or HR system and is currently **view-only**.
If your organization’s directory integration (such as Google Workspace or JumpCloud) is active, these values will update automatically based on your synced profile.

<Admonition type="note">
    Profile details cannot be edited directly within ShiftControl.
    To make updates, modify your information in your connected directory or HR system.
</Admonition>

## Security Methods

The **Security Methods** tab shows authentication-related settings, such as your login provider or MFA configuration (if applicable).
You can remove any existing authentication methods from this page, but adding new methods must be done through the JumpCloud console at https://console.jumpcloud.com.
