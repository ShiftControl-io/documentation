## Overview

The **Group Tags** page under **Org Settings** allows administrators to create, edit, and organize the tag categories available to all groups in the organization.
Group tags help classify and filter groups across the platform — making it easier to organize large sets of user groups by purpose, department, or access type.

## Purpose of Group Tags

Group tags serve as reusable labels to categorize groups within your organization.
They make it easier to organize, search, and automate group-related workflows.
Administrators often use tags to represent **team function**, **access level**, or **organizational purpose**.

Here are a few common examples:

| Tag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Alerts** | Used for system or vendor alerts and notifications. Example: groups receiving monitoring or status alerts. |
| **Catch-all** | Represents addresses like `hello@`, `contact@`, or `legal@` — mailboxes that aggregate general inbound messages. |
| **Department** | Defines official departments or teams, e.g., *Engineering*, *Finance*, *Marketing*. |
| **Role Access** | Used for groups mapped to specific permissions or roles such as *AWS Admin Access* or *Finance Data Viewers*. |
| **Service Account** | Tied to automated accounts in SaaS or infrastructure systems (e.g., bots or connectors). |
| **Support** | Internal help addresses such as `it-support@` or `hr@` for handling employee requests. |

These tags appear in **Group Management**, where they can be applied to individual groups to improve visibility and filtering.

    Use clear, consistent tag names across your organization to make automation and reporting easier.

## Viewing and Searching Tags

Use the search bar to locate tags by **name** or **description**.
Each tag in the list displays:

- **Color** — The visual identifier for quick scanning.
- **Group Tag Name** — The tag label visible when assigning tags to groups.
- **Description** — A short explanation of the tag’s purpose.

You can sort or download the tag list using the toolbar controls.

## Creating a Group Tag

To add a new tag:

1. Click **Add Group Tag** at the top right of the screen.
2. Fill out the form fields:
- **Tag Name** – The name of the tag (e.g., “Service Account”).
- **Tag Color** – Choose a color for easy visual identification.
- **Description** – A short note describing the tag’s purpose.
3. Click **Create Tag** to save.

## Editing or Deleting Tags

Each tag includes a **⋮ menu** with options to **Edit** or **Delete**.

- **Edit** — Update the tag’s name, color, or description.
You can use the color picker or enter a custom HEX code as an example.  All fields are editable by double-clicking on the field.

- **Delete** — Permanently remove a tag from the organization.
Once deleted, any groups using that tag will no longer display it.
