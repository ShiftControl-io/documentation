## Overview

The **App Connectors** page lists and manages your integrations with third-party SaaS applications.
These connectors pull user and app data into ShiftControl, enabling better visibility into who’s using which apps and where licenses are active.

Each connector displays:
- **Connector** – The service or integration name (e.g., Slack, HubSpot, Box).
- **App name** – The connected app record in your catalog.
- **Status** – Whether the connector is enabled or disabled.
- **Health** – Connection health and data sync status.
- **Auth Status** – Indicates whether authentication has been provided or is required.

## How App Connectors Work

App connectors use secure OAuth or API-based integrations to communicate with supported third-party services.
Once connected, ShiftControl automatically syncs user information and app metadata at regular intervals (usually every hour).

These integrations make it easier to:
- See which users are active in each app.
- Identify unused or duplicate licenses.
- Centralize app management across your organization.

<Admonition type="tip">
    You can view all available connectors in the **App Catalog**.
    If a service you use isn’t listed yet, you can still add it as a **Custom App**.

## Enabling an App Connector

To enable a connector:
1. Locate the desired app in the list.
2. Click the **⋮ menu** and choose **Authenticate**.
3. Complete the OAuth or API key authentication flow.
4. Once connected, the **Status** will change to **Enabled**, and **Auth Status** will show as **Authentication provided**.

<Admonition type="note">
    Some integrations (like Slack or HubSpot) may require admin-level permissions to complete the connection.
</Admonition>

## Managing Connectors

After setup, you can:
- **Disable** a connector to pause syncs temporarily.
- **Reauthenticate** if credentials expire or permissions change.
- **Delete authorization** to fully disconnect the app.

See our [Connector Management](/using-shiftcontrol/Integrations/Connector-management) page for more details.
