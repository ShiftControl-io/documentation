## Interface & Theme

Select your preferred interface color scheme from the available options:

- **Light** — Bright interface suitable for well-lit environments or standard daytime use.
- **Dark** — Reduces glare and eye strain, ideal for low-light or nighttime work.
- **System** — Automatically adapts to your operating system’s theme settings.

Once selected, your choice is saved immediately and applies across the entire app interface.
