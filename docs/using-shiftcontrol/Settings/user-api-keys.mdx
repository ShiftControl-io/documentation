<p style={{fontSize: "large"}}>Manage personal API keys for integrating or automating actions with ShiftControl.</p>

## Overview

The **User API Keys** page lets individual users generate and manage their own API keys.
These keys are **personal** and scoped to your account — they allow integrations or scripts to perform actions on your behalf, using your permissions.

## Viewing and Managing Keys

- **Search and Filter**: Use the search bar to locate specific keys by name or purpose.
- **List View**: The table shows each key’s **name**, **purpose**, **creation date**, and **expiration**.
- **Export or Copy**: Use the toolbar buttons to copy key data or download a list of your keys.
