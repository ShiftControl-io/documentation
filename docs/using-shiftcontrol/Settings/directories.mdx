## Overview

The **Directories** page lets you connect to your organization’s **HRIS** (Human Resources Information Systems) and **Identity Providers (IdPs)**.
These integrations sync users, departments, locations, and other key organizational data into ShiftControl, helping automate onboarding, offboarding, and access management.

Each directory shows:
- **Connector** – The service name (e.g., Google, JumpCloud, BambooHR).
- **App Name** – The corresponding app integration.
- **Type** – HRIS or Identity Provider.
- **Status** – Whether the connector is enabled or disabled.
- **Health** – Indicates whether data synchronization is running properly.
- **Auth Status** – Shows whether authentication is required or has been provided.
- **Primary** – Identifies which Identity Provider is the organization’s main source of truth.

## Directory Types

### HRIS
Integrations such as **BambooHR**, **Deel**, or **HiBob** automatically sync employee details, departments, and locations.
They’re the backbone for keeping user records up to date across systems.

See our [Integration Management](/using-shiftcontrol/Integrations/Integration-management) page for more details.

### Identity Providers
Integrations like **Google Workspace** and **JumpCloud** manage authentication and account lifecycle events.
They provide secure user identity management and are often used as the organization’s **primary directory**.

<Admonition type="tip">
    For most organizations, it’s best to connect both an HRIS and an Identity Provider — the HRIS manages employee records, while the IdP manages login and access.
</Admonition>

## Enabling a Directory

To enable a directory connector:
1. Click the **⋮ menu** beside the directory you want to enable.
2. Choose **Authenticate** to connect your account.
3. Once authenticated, the **Status** will update to **Enabled** and the **Health** indicator will show **Healthy** when sync is successful.

<Admonition type="note">
    Most connectors require admin-level credentials to authorize the integration.
    Once connected, ShiftControl will automatically start syncing directory data every hour.
</Admonition>

## Managing Connected Directories

After setup, each directory can be:
- **Disabled** – Pauses syncing but keeps previous data cached.
- **Reauthenticated** – If your authorization token expires.
- **Set as Primary** – Determines which directory ShiftControl uses for identity data and user provisioning.
