## Overview

The **User Roles** page lets administrators control who has access to different parts of ShiftControl.
The system uses **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to assign permissions to users based on their responsibilities — ensuring that only authorized users can manage sensitive settings.

Roles can be tailored to provide varying levels of control, such as:

| Role | Description |
| ---- | ------------ |
| **Full Admin** | Complete access to all settings, integrations, and data. |
| **Read-only Admin** | Can view all configuration and reports, but cannot make changes. |

<Admonition type="tip">
    Use role separation to improve security — not everyone who manages users needs access to billing, API keys, or integrations.
</Admonition>

## Viewing and Searching Roles

The User Roles list displays all users who currently have administrative access.
Each entry includes:
- **User** — The name and email of the admin.
- **Roles** — The specific roles assigned to that user.

You can use the search bar to quickly locate users or filter by assigned role.

## Adding or Editing an Admin User

To create or update an admin’s assigned roles:

1. Click **Add Admin User** (or the **⋮ menu → Edit**) to open the role editor.
2. Select the **Admin User** from your organization’s directory.
3. Under **Assigned Roles**, choose one or more roles from the dropdown.
4. Click **Save** to confirm.

The flow for **creating** and **editing** roles is identical — you can modify role assignments at any time.

<Admonition type="note">
    All changes take effect immediately. Users may need to refresh their browser for access changes to apply.

## Removing an Admin User

To revoke administrative access:
1. Open the **⋮ menu** next to the user’s name.
2. Select **Remove Admin User**.
3. Confirm the action — the user will immediately lose admin privileges.

<Admonition type="tip">
    Before removing an admin, make sure another user has the same role if the responsibilities need to be maintained.
