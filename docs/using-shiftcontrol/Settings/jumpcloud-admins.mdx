## Overview

The **JumpCloud Admins** page allows you to view, create, and manage the administrator accounts used to connect to your organization’s JumpCloud directory.
These accounts are required to perform actions such as reading user data, syncing group memberships, and automating IT management tasks.

Each admin entry includes:
- **Admin** – The name and email of the JumpCloud administrator.
- **Admin Role** – The assigned role within JumpCloud (e.g., Administrator).
- **Enabled** – Whether the admin account is active.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication** – Indicates if MFA is enabled for this account.
- **TOTP Enrolled** – Shows whether the admin has a TOTP authenticator configured.
- **API Access** – Displays if the admin has API access enabled.

<Admonition type="tip">
    JumpCloud Admin accounts are separate from employee accounts.
    We recommend using a format like <code>user+admin@domain.com</code> to distinguish admin logins from normal users.

## Creating a JumpCloud Admin

To create a new JumpCloud admin:
1. Click **Add JumpCloud Admin**.
2. Fill out the following fields:
- **First name** and **Last name**
- **Admin email**
- **Admin role** (e.g., Administrator)
- Toggle **Enable API access** if this admin will be used for API-based automation.
3. Click **Save** to create the admin record.

<Admonition type="note">
    The new admin will receive an invitation via email. Once they accept, their account will appear as active in the JumpCloud console and in ShiftControl.
</Admonition>

## Editing and Managing Admins

You can manage each admin using the **⋮ menu** beside their name:
- **Edit** – Update the admin’s role or API access status.
- **Disable JumpCloud Admin** – Temporarily suspend the account’s access without deleting it.
- **Delete JumpCloud Admin** – Permanently remove the account from the list.

## Best Practices

- Create **dedicated integration accounts** with clear naming (e.g., <code>automation+admin@yourdomain.com</code>).
- Periodically **review admin access** and disable accounts that are no longer needed.
- Keep **API access** enabled only for automation accounts that require it.
