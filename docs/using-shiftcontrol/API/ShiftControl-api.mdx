## What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It provides a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications.

## Common Use Cases

Our customers use the ShiftControl API for various purposes, such as:

- **Updating Redirect URIs**: When deploying a new test of their system, customers need to update the redirect URI of an OIDC app to manage the current active redirect URI endpoints. The API can automate this process.
- **Integration with Other Apps**: You can integrate ShiftControl with other applications like Make, Zapier, or Workato to automate workflows and enhance functionality.
- **Automating User Management**: You can automate user management tasks like creating, updating, or deleting users in ShiftControl using the API.

## API Documentation

You can find our API documentation at [ShiftControl API Docs](https://api.shiftcontrol.io/api-docs). The documentation is available in Scalar, Redoc, and Swagger formats, and you can execute and test APIs directly on our site.

## API Tokens

- **User API Tokens**: These tokens are associated with individual users and provide access to user-specific data and actions. These tokens have limited rights based on the user's role and permissions.
- **Org API Tokens**: These tokens are associated with an organization and provide access to organization-wide data and actions. These are top-level admin tokens and have all rights.
- **Access Tokens**: These tokens are used to authenticate API requests from our Frontend and ensure secure communication between applications.

The ShiftControl API provides powerful tools to automate and integrate various functions, making it easier to manage your IT environment.

## Using Postman with ShiftControl API

Postman is a popular API client that allows you to test and automate API requests.

To use Postman with our API:

1. Download the [OpenAPI Spec](https://api.shiftcontrol.io/api-docs/openapi.json) from our site.
2. Import the OpenAPI Spec into Postman.
