## Overview

Slack is a popular communications tool that supports channels, direct messaging, and integrations with various tools and services. It is popular amongst tech companies and is often used to communicate between companies using a feature called Slack Connect.

### Supported Licenses

#### All paid licenses

    - Login with Google: Available on all Slack licenses, allowing users to authenticate using their Google accounts.
    - Enforce Google Login: Option to enforce Google as the sole login source.

#### Business+ and higher

	- Single Sign-On (SSO): Enables secure and streamlined login through a single authentication source.
	- User Sync: Allows for automated user management and synchronization.

### What you need to know

<Accordion title="Slack has a powerful feature to enforce logging in with Google">
  We highly recommend using the feature to enforce logins via Google. This powerful feature is unique, as most tools don't allow you to enforce (require) this type of login. What this does in practice is force your users to authenticate to Slack using Google. As long as you have Google integrated into ShiftControl for Single Sign-on (SSO) then all your Slack users are protected by powerful SSO through Google.
</Accordion>

## Configure Login with Google

<Admonition type="info">Slack calls Login with Google "Google Workspace single sign-on". They also sometimes refer to it as "Google Auth".</Admonition>

We will configure Google as an authentication method and set it to enforce it to make sure people can only log in using Google.

<Admonition type="warning">We recommend you plan this change and notify your users how their experience will change and when the change will take effect</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info">**Tip:** Workspace Owners and Org Owners can bypass SSO authentication by using the link at the bottom of the login page to sign in with email address and password. This guarantees access to your workspace or org, even if your IDP is having issues.</Admonition>

<Steps>
 <Step title="Log into your Slack Workspace as a Workspace Owner">
    Log in to your Slack Workspace. You need to be a Workspace owner to complete these steps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click on your workspace">
    From your desktop, click your workspace name in the sidebar.

  <Step title="Go to workspace settings">
    Select Tools & settings from the menu, then click Workspace settings.

      alt="Authentication tab"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Google Authentication">
    Next to Google Apps authentication, click Configure.
    <img
      src="/img/App-Guides/Slack/Slack-Configure-Google-Auth.png"
      alt="Configure Google Auth"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify settings and save">
    Expand the settings and modify them.  We recommend the following settings:
    | Setting Name | Enabled | Explanation |
    |-- |-- |-- |
    | Update profile each time a user logs in | Yes | Enable to make sure any profile changes in ShiftControl show up in Slack the next time the user authenticates. |
    | Allow users to change their email address | No | Allowing users to change their own emails is dangerous, you should control the email they use to log in to Slack. |
    | Allow users to change their display name | No | We think it is cleaner to standardize display names, but this one is really up to you and your company culture! |
    | Google auth must be used by | All Members, except guest accounts | This enforces Google authentication for everyone in your company. Guests are excluded because they usually don't have Google Workspace accounts. |
    
    Click Save Configuration when you are done.

      alt="Google Auth Settings"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate to Google">
    You will be asked to authenticate with your Google account.
    <Admonition type="note">You do not need to authenticate with a Google Workspace Admin. Any user will work.</Admonition>
    <Admonition type="warning">If the person that does this step is offboarded from the company (e.g., they no longer have a Google account), then another Slack Workspace Owner will need to come here and authenticate again to re-enable Login with Google.</Admonition>
    <img
      src="/img/App-Guides/Slack/Slack-Authenticate-with-Google.png"
      alt="Auth to Google"
    />
  </Step>
</Steps>

Congratulations, your Slack workspace is now set up for Login via Google!

## How users are created

When a user goes to Slack for the first time, they will log in via Google and their account will automatically be created. No action is required for onboarding.

## Add the app as a bookmark

If you are configuring Slack for Login with Google, you'll want to add the app as a bookmark.
