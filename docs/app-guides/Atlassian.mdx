## Overview

The Atlassian Suite of products is a comprehensive set of collaboration tools designed for project management, software development, and team communication, including popular applications like Jira, Confluence, Trello, and Bitbucket.

### Supported Licenses

#### All Licenses

While Atlassian does support signing in with Google, they don't allow you to enforce it. That means that signing in with Google makes things easier for your employees, but their usernames and passwords can still be compromised. Atlassian also doesn't require multi-factor authentication by default, so you could be at risk if you don't enforce this for your organization.

#### Atlassian Guard

In order to configure and use Single Sign-On (SSO) and SCIM with Atlassian products you need to purchase an Atlassian Guard license for your users. You can find out more info [here](https://www.atlassian.com/software/access)

<Admonition type="note">Atlassian Guard was formerly called Atlassian Access</Admonition>

### What you need to know

<Accordion title="Atlassian Guard is an additional service/license that provides SSO access for all Atlassian products">
  Atlassian is somewhat unique because they provide a difference license/product that provides SSO access to all their products across the board. This is powerful because you can buy it once and apply it to many services, but can also be frustrating because we don't think you should have to pay to enable this kind of security on any service.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Atlassian security defaults are very weak, we highly recommend implementing better defaults">
 Atlassian defaults to weak passwords (no special characters or numbers needed) and doesn't require multi-factor authentication. To us, this is pretty much a crime! We highly recommend that you take a few minutes to ensure that your security settings are set to a stronger set of defaults for your entire organization. Please follow the guide in this doc, especially if you won't be purchasing Atlassian Guard.
</Accordion>

## Enabling Third-Party Login via Google

Atlassian enables third-party login via Google by default. If it was disabled for any reason in your organization you can follow this guide to turn it back on. Do this if you want to make it easier for your employees to login via Google.

<Admonition type="note">You don't need to do this if you plan to use Atlassian Guard! Atlassian Guard will enforce SSO via JumpCloud.</Admonition>

<Steps>
 <Step title="Log in to Atlassian as an admin">
    Log in to the Atlassian Admin Panel at https://admin.atlassian.com as an admin.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Security">
    Click on the Security tab at the top.
    <img
      src="/img/App-Guides/Atlassian/Atlassian-Security-Tab.png"
      alt="Atlassian Security Tab"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Authentication Policies">
    Click on the Authentication Policies menu on the left.
    <img
      src="/img/App-Guides/Atlassian/Atlassian-Authentication-Policies.png"
      alt="Authentication Policies"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit your default policy">
    Your organization may already have several authentication policies configured. Here we'll walk you through updating a default policy.
    Find your default policy and click on the Edit button.
    <img
      src="/img/App-Guides/Atlassian/Atlassian-Edit-the-default-policy.png"
      alt="Edit the default policy"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable third-party login">
    Make sure that "Allow third-party login" is enabled.
    <Admonition type="note">You could take this chance to also make sure you have better defaults set for your security policies. Follow the guide in this document to implement stronger security default!</Admonition>
    <img
      src="/img/App-Guides/Atlassian/Atlassian-Set-third-party-logins-to-true.png"
      alt="Set third party logins to true"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click update">
    Click the update button at the bottom.
    <img
      src="/img/App-Guides/Atlassian/Atlassian-Click-Update.png"
      alt="Click update"
    />
  </Step>
</Steps>

Any user that matches the policy is now able to login to Atlassian via their Google account.

## Configuring stronger security defaults

By default, Atlassian sets the security policies for your organization to be very insecure. By using these defaults you have significant risk of being compromised. We'll help you set your security policies to something safer that doesn't impact your employee productivity.

<Admonition type="note">We recommend doing this even if you are configuring Atlassian Guard because some accounts such as admins can bypass SSO configurations.</Admonition>

<Steps>
 <Step title="Log in to Atlassian as an admin">
    Log in to the Atlassian Admin Panel at https://admin.atlassian.com as an admin.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Security">
    Click on the Security tab at the top.
    <img
      src="/img/App-Guides/Atlassian/Atlassian-Security-Tab.png"
      alt="Atlassian Security Tab"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Authentication Policies">
    Click on the Authentication Policies menu on the left.
    <img
      src="/img/App-Guides/Atlassian/Atlassian-Authentication-Policies.png"
      alt="Authentication Policies"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit your default policy">
    Your organization may already have several authentication policies configured. Here we'll walk you through updating a default policy.
    Find your default policy and click on the Edit button.
    <img
      src="/img/App-Guides/Atlassian/Atlassian-Edit-the-default-policy.png"
      alt="Edit the default policy"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Require two-step verification">
    Click on the Mandatory button to require two-step verification. This means that Atlassian will ask for a username, password, and an additional factor like a one time password or passkey.
    <img
      src="/img/App-Guides/Atlassian/Atlassian-Enable-Two-step-verification.png"
      alt="Enable two-step verification"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable third-party login">
    We recommend that you enable third-party logins to make it easier for employees to login without a normal username and password, especially if you didn't purchase Atlassian Guard.
    <img
      src="/img/App-Guides/Atlassian/Atlassian-Set-third-party-logins-to-true.png"
      alt="Set third party logins to true"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set strong passwords as the default">
    You should change the minimum password strength to at least Strong. You can also choose Stronger if you'd like. We don't think it's necessarily useful to force a user to change their password periodically, unless you have compliance reasons to do so. Forcing password changes often forces worse passwords because users try to use patterns to make it easier.
    <img
      src="/img/App-Guides/Atlassian/Atlassian-Default-to-strong-passwords.png"
      alt="Default to strong passwords"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click update">
    Click the update button at the bottom.
    <img
      src="/img/App-Guides/Atlassian/Atlassian-Click-Update.png"
      alt="Click update"
    />
  </Step>
</Steps>

Any user that matches the policy is now required to register a for multi-factor authentication  next time they log in and set a strong password. Congratulations, your organization is now more secure!

    You will be able to see how many members are tied to each policy, and can see the details if you click on Edit for the policy and view the Member tab. If you don't have any members assigned to the SSO policy, you'll need to make sure you assign users or groups to the app in ShiftControl.

    Users will be in either in the local directory policy or the JumpCloud policy, depending on when they were created.
    | When the user was created | Policy Assignment |
    |--- |--- |
    | Existing user created before SSO configuration | The user will be in the local directory policy until they are moved to the SSO policy. |
    | A user synced in via User Sync that didn't exist before SSO configuration | The user will be in the JumpCloud policy from the start. |

Congratulations, you have configured SSO and User Sync for Atlassian!

## Understanding Group Sync

One powerful feature of ShiftControl and this integration with Atlassian is the ability to sync groups to Atlassian and update them dynamically. You can use these groups in your permissions scheme or anywhere you can reference a group in Atlassian.

Any group that you assign to the Atlassian app in ShiftControl will automatically be synced to Atlassian.

You can view the groups that are synced in the Atlassian site.

<Steps>
 <Step title="Log in to Atlassian as an admin">
    Log in to the Atlassian Admin Panel at https://admin.atlassian.com as an admin.

## Assigning users to the SSO Authentication Policy

You should only take this step once you are ready to have everyone in your organization use SSO to log in to Atlassian.

### Prerequisites

You should already have added all the users to the application in ShiftControl. If you miss this step, then the users will be forced to use SSO but they won't be able to login because they wouldn't have yet been assigned the application.

### Move users to the JumpCloud Authentication Policy
