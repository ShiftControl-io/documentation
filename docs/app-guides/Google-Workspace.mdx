## Overview

ShiftControl supports both user sync and Single Sign-On (SSO) for Google Workspace. Since Google Workspace is a core application in many organizations and has its own directory of users, it is treated a bit differently than regular SSO apps.

Google Workspace user synchronization is handled through a dedicated Google App via JumpCloud. However, once we enforce SSO, your users will need to be assigned the SSO application in order to log into Google Workspace and related services.

### Supported Licenses

Google Workspace supports SSO on all licenses!

### What you need to know

<Accordion title="Google will only provision a user if licenses are available">
  If you find that you have created a user but they don't have an account automatically created in Google Workspace, please check to make sure that you have enough licenses to add more users.
  If you don't, you'll need to first add/purchase licenses before the user will sync in.
  <Admonition type="note">In many cases, especially if you are on an annual plan, adding a licenses incurs costs. Be sure you are ready to use the license before you add it, as you will not be able to reduce the license until your annual renewal on annual plans.</Admonition>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Google does not enforce SSO for Admins">
  If you are using a Google account that has an Administrator role then Google will not enforce SSO in order to make sure that admins aren't locked out of Google.

  This is an odd choice by Google, but something you should be aware of. Depending on your SSO configuration, the admin experience will differ.

<Accordion title="We always recommend having a separate admin account to administer Google Workspace">
 Google Workspace is likely one of your more sensitive SaaS services. It contains not only your entire user directory, but also many sensitive emails, documents, and more.

 We highly recommend avoiding using your normal "Daily Driver" Google account for administrating Google Workspace. Keep a separate account with a very strong password in a password manager and use it as needed. You can forward the emails from your admin account to your main account to keep up to date on notifications.

 This type of admin separation is recommended because your main account can get compromised and they won't be able to completely compromise your environment. It also gives admins a better user experience because of the way SSO works in Google Workspace.

 <Admonition type="info">Adding additional admins incurs regular user costs. We think this extra cost is worth is, and you should limit the users who have admin anyways!</Admonition>
</Accordion>

## Add a Google Application and Configure SSO

Follow these instructions in order to add Google Workspace to ShiftControl and configure Single Sign-on (SSO).

We recommend configuring SSO for your entire organization and excluding any Organization Units (OUs) as required. Please see the "Google does not enforce SSO for Admins" in the previous section for more info on why we recommend this.

### Create an OU to test authentication

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to the Google Workspace Admin Panel">
    Go to https://admin.google.com, log in as an Admin.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage OUs">
    Go to Directory→Organizational Units
        <img
          src="/img/App-Guides/Google/Google-Organizational-Units.png"
          alt="Access Organizational Units"
        />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an OU">
    Click on Create organizational unit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an OU">
    Set the name as SSO-Test, give it a description, and add it to your parent organization
    <Admonition type="note">If you already have OUs setup, you may choose to put this somewhere that makes more sense for your structure.</Admonition>
    <img
      src="/img/App-Guides/Google/Google-Create-organizational-unit.png"
      alt="Create organizational unit"
    />
  </Step>
</Steps>

You've not created an Organization Unit that we can use to assign our SSO configuration. We'll use this to ensure we can test it before you deploy it for all users.

### (Optional) Configure a SAML Profile to configure SSO

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to SSO with third-party IdP">
    Go to Security→Authentication→SSO with third party IdP
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add SAML profile">
    We’ll add a profile first so we can test SSO for a specific OU, click on ADD SAML PROFILE
    <img
      src="/img/App-Guides/Google/Google-Add-SAML-profile.png"
      alt="Add SAML profile"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the SAML profile">
    Configure the SAML profile:
    <ol>
      <li>SSO profile name: SSO or any other unique name</li>
      <li>IDP Entity ID: yourdomain.com</li>
      <li>Sign-in Page URL: The “IDP URL” from the app’s SSO page in JumpCloud (Soon to be shown in ShiftControl)</li>
      <li>Sign-out page URL: https://console.jumpcloud.com</li>
      <li>Change password URL: https://console.jumpcloud.com</li>
      <li>Upload the certificate: Found by clicking Download certificate on the left in the app’s SSO page in JumpCloud (Soon to be available in ShiftControl)</li>

      alt="Save SAML profile"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the configuration page">
    You’ll come to a page that shows the configuration, we’ll need the Entity ID and ACS URL.
    <img
      src="/img/App-Guides/Google/Google-Review-configuration.png"
      alt="Save SAML profile"
    />
  </Step>
    <Step title="Copy the SP Entity ID">
      Copy the Entity ID and paste it into JumpCloud’s App in the SSO area (Coming soon to the ShiftControl UI):

      alt="Copy the ACS Url"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click Save in JumpCloud and Click Back in Google Workspace. We’re now ready to assign the profile to your OU.
  </Step>
</Steps>

From here, you can open an incognito window and try authenticating to [google.com](https://google.com). Make sure the user you are using to test with is assigned the Application in the ShiftControl admin panel.
