## Overview

Once the onboarding session is complete, there are a few important tasks to focus on. These will help ensure that your team is set up for success and that your security configurations are solid. Weâ€™ll continue to provide support and share tools to help you manage your users and apps effectively moving forward.

### Organizing User Groups
Continue to think through how you want to organize your users into groups for easy app and access management.

### App Setup & SSO Configuration
You can begin setting up additional apps and creating bookmarks. You can find configuration instructions in our [App Guides](https://docs.shiftcontrol.io/app-guides/Atlassian) but don't hesitate to let us know if the app you're looking for ins't in the guides yet. Once configured, assign the apps to the right user groups.

### Admin Setup & MFA Policies
Ensure all admins have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled for security. We also recommend encouraging all users to set up MFA to strengthen overall security.

### Change Management Communication
We will share a series of email templates that you can use to inform your team about the changes and what to expect going forward.

### Ongoing Support
You'll have access to a dedicated Slack support channel for any questions or issues. We'll also use this channel to announce new features and schedule additional walkthroughs as needed.
