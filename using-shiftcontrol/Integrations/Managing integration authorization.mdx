When managing integrations, you can provide one of two types of credentials depending on the integration:

1. **API Key**: Directly enter an admin-level API key.
2. **OAuth**: Go through an OAuth flow to authorize ShiftControl, such as for Google Workspace.

Both processes are supported, and the one you use depends on the integration. The same process is used whether you’re adding a new integration or updating existing credentials. All credentials are stored securely and can only be accessed by our systems.

## Adding or Updating an API Key
For API-based integrations, such as GitHub:

<Steps>

    <Step title="Navigate to the Integration to Configure">
        Click on the action menu for the integration you wish to configure, and click either Add Authorization or Edit
        Authorization.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Provide the API Key">
        Enter the **API key** in the field.

        <img
            src="/images/ShiftControl/Integrations/Integration add API key.png"
            alt="Integration API Key"
        />
    </Step>

    <Step title="Click Save">
        Click **Save** to apply the key and authorize the integration.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Integration Authenticated">
        Once the key is saved, the integration will be authenticated, and ShiftControl will start interacting with the
        app.
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Adding or Updating an OAuth Integration

For OAuth-based integrations, such as Google Workspace:

<Steps>

    <Step title="Navigate to the Integration to Configure">
        Click on the action menu for the integration you wish to configure, and click either Add Authorization or Edit
        Authorization.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Redirect to OAuth Authorization Flow">
        You will be redirected to the **OAuth authorization flow** for the chosen integration.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Provide Consent">
        Follow the flow and provide your consent for ShiftControl to interact with the app.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Return to ShiftControl">
        After completing the flow, you will be redirected back to ShiftControl, and you’ll see a confirmation message
        like the one below:
        <img
            src="/images/ShiftControl/Integrations/Intgration oAuth success.png"
            alt="OAuth Authorization Success"
        />
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Updating an Integration

To update credentials for an existing integration, follow the same process as when adding a new one—either entering a new API key or going through the OAuth authorization flow again.

## Security

All credentials provided, whether through API key or OAuth, are securely stored and used only by ShiftControl systems. We ensure that these credentials are encrypted and accessible only by authorized processes.
