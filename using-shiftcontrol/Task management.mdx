**Task Management** allows you to track tasks that require your attention. Each task represents an event or action that needs review or completion within your organization.

## View Tasks

- **Task List**: The list of tasks that require your attention, including the task title, description, assigned user, and status.
- **Search**: Use the search bar to find specific tasks.
- **Filters**: Filter the list based on the status.

## Task Actions

You can take the following actions on tasks:

- **Dismiss**: Remove the task from the list if it's no longer relevant or has been completed.
- **Mark as Unread**: Mark the task as unread to remind yourself to review it later.

## Bulk Actions

You can also take bulk actions on multiple tasks at once. Select the tasks you want to manage, then click the **Bulk Actions** button to take the same actions as are available in individual task actions.
