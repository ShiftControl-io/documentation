Apps are all the tools and services your organization uses to manage operations, serve your customers, and engage with your employees. ShiftControl helps to manage and organize SaaS applications for your organization.

## Types of apps

### SSO Apps

SSO (Single Sign-On) apps are divided into two categories within ShiftControl:

1.	**Catalog Apps:** ShiftControl offers an extensive catalog of pre-configured SSO apps that you can search for and integrate seamlessly. This catalog includes a wide range of popular SaaS applications, making it easy for you to find and set up SSO for the tools your organization uses most frequently.
2.	**Custom SSO Integrations:** For apps that are not already included in our catalog, ShiftControl provides the flexibility to create custom SSO integrations. This means you can still benefit from the convenience and security of single sign-on, even for niche or proprietary applications. Custom integrations ensure that all your apps, regardless of their inclusion in our catalog, can be securely and efficiently managed through ShiftControl.

By leveraging both catalog and custom SSO apps, your organization can streamline access management and enhance security, reducing the need for multiple login credentials and minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.

### Bookmarks

In addition to SSO apps, ShiftControl also supports bookmarks for each app in our catalog. Bookmarks serve as a convenient alternative for situations where you do not have a license that supports SSO but still want to ensure that your users can easily find and access the app.

Bookmarks allow you to add apps to your usersâ€™ App Dashboard without configuring SSO. This is particularly useful when:

- You are in the process of obtaining an SSO-compatible license but want to provide immediate access to the app.
- You are using a free or basic version of an app that does not include SSO support.
- You want to centralize access to frequently used tools and services for ease of navigation and user convenience.

With bookmarks, you can maintain a comprehensive view of all the apps your organization uses, ensuring that employees have quick and easy access to the tools they need, all from one centralized location. This not only enhances productivity but also simplifies the user experience, making it easier for users to find and utilize the resources available to them.
