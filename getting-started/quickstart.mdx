## Trust JumpCloud in Google Workspace

If you use Google Workspace, the first thing you'll need to do it trust the JumpCloud apps in your Google Workspace Admin interface.

This process is only required if an organization has their API Controls for Google Workspace Admin set to restricted, but we recommend following the process no matter what to ensure the apps are authorized.

<Note>
If the app doesn't have the right permissions, you'll receive a 400 error admin_policy_enforce ([Read more](https://jumpcloud.com/support/troubleshoot-google-workspace-integration#_error_400__admin_policy_enforced_)) when trying to approve the JumpCloud app during initial setup.
</Note>

You can trust the JumpCloud apps in order to add them without having to lower the restrictions enforced.

The following apps will need to be approved/trusted:

| App Name | Purpose | Identifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JumpCloud | Directory Sync of users and groups from JumpCloud | 409100557052-up2bjo6c85fdvipudtkaqr7jqsesqnam.apps.googleusercontent.com |
| JumpCloud | Single Sign-On | 629652647736-b7u1qe4oktmn7b6vnmdbabrd32lds4as.apps.googleusercontent.com |
